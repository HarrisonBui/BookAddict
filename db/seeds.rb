Natasha Leonova&rsquo;s beauty saved her life. Discovered on a freezing Moscow street by a Russian billionaire, she has lived for seven years under his protection, immersed in rarefied luxury, while he pursues his activities in a dark world that she guesses at but never sees. Her home is the world, often on one of Vladimir Stanislas&rsquo;s spectacular yachts manned by scores of heavily armed crew members. Natasha&rsquo;s job is to keep Vladimir happy, ask no questions, and be discreet. She knows her place, and the rules. She feels fortunate to be spoiled and protected, and is careful not to dwell on Vladimir&rsquo;s ruthlessness or the deadly circles he moves in. She experiences only his kindness and generosity and believes he will always keep her safe. She is unfailingly loyal to him in exchange. Theo Luca is the son of a brilliant, world famous, and difficult artist, Lorenzo Luca, who left his wife and son with a fortune in artwork they refuse to sell. Lorenzo&rsquo;s widow, Maylis, has transformed their home in St. Paul de Vence into a celebrated restaurant decorated with her late husband&rsquo;s paintings, and treats it as a museum. There, on a warm June evening, Theo first encounters Natasha, the most exquisite woman he has ever seen. And there, Vladimir lays eyes on Luca&rsquo;s artwork. Two dangerous obsessions begin. Theo, a gifted artist in his own right, finds himself feverishly painting Natasha&rsquo;s image for weeks after their first meeting. Vladimir, enraged that Lorenzo&rsquo;s works are not for sale, is determined to secure a painting at any price. And Natasha, who knows that she cannot afford to make even one false move, nevertheless begins to think of a world of freedom she can never experience as Vladimir&rsquo;s mistress. She cannot risk her safety for another man, or even a conversation with him, as Theo longs for a woman he can never have.  From Moscow to the Riviera, Paris, and London, The Mistress is a riveting tale of vast fortune, cruelty, creative genius, and daring courage, as uncompromising individuals chart a course for collision.", amazon_link: "https://www.amazon.com/Mistress-Novel-Danielle-Steel/dp/0345531116", kobo_link: "https://kobo.com", play_link: "https://play.google.com/store/books" })

I found myself re-reading complete paragraphs previously encountered earlier in the book. Even more peculiar were incidents described in minute detail before they had even occurred in the chronology.My only conclusion is that Danielle Steele overused the copy/cut and paste feature of her word processor. I envisioned her using a collection of paragraphs much like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. Her problem was that the pieces did not quite fit together.At the hefty price tag for this book, she and her publisher are insulting her readers. The story itself is mundane and uninteresting. She could have told it in a novella. After slogging through chapter after chapter, I finally reached the unsatisfactory conclusion.Assigning a book only one star is rare for me.

He is living the dream, and his marriage to the bewitching Vivian is the center of that.

In a matter of months, Russ finds himself without a job or wife, caring for his young daughter while struggling to adapt to a new and baffling reality. Throwing himself into the wilderness of single parenting, Russ embarks on a journey at once terrifying and rewarding-one that will test his abilities and his emotional resources beyond anything he ever imagined.", amazon_link: "https://www.amazon.com/Two-Nicholas-Sparks/dp/1455520691", kobo_link: "https://kobo.com", play_link: "https://play.google.com/store/books" })

It is a story of love, hurt, family, courage and healing. It is a story that will make you laugh and cry with the narrator, advertising executive Russell Green, who hadn&#8217;t given much thought about having a child when his wife Vivian broke the news. When London was born, Vivian quits her job to be a stay-at-home mom. When Russell quits his job to start his own business, Vivian decides to return to work, slowly but surely letting them drift apart. With his wife working, Russell took charge of London, showering her with his attention, affection and love. When the inevitable happened in his marriage, though not unexpected, Russell was shattered.Nicholas Sparks&#8217; Two by Two is a poignant though not an out of this world story. It is a story that is regrettably becoming a familiarity, at least some parts of it. Four different women played important roles in shaping Russell Green. Vivian, Emily, Marge and London. Vivian gave him a daughter, Marge stood by him to weather the storms during his most difficult days, Emily&#8217;s appearance almost seemed preordained and London, she was his everything. But to each of them he was a different person. He was a husband to Vivian, a brother to Marge, a suitor to Emily and a father to London. Through these characters and their stories, Nicholas Sparks explored the strength and frailty of human relationship, and the ties that bind two people together.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user1.id, book_id: book2.id })

I could not have been more wrong, but I almost wish Mr. Sparks would go back to his old clich&eacute;.Instead the book comes off more like a Taylor Swift break-up song she writes for the sole purpose of revenge.  At first Russ and Vivian are a happy newlywed couple.  Very quickly their daughter London comes along and they settle into a typical middle class life with her staying home and him going off to his fancy PR job.  But when he feels insecure at work he quits his job and starts his own company without getting a single client ready first. He then becomes bitter and feels insecure.  Vivian gets a job with Walter Spannerman (read that as Donald Trump) and Russ is resentful.  The next 7 chapters are from his point of view as he complains because he has to spend time with his daughter, taking her to her activities and doing household chores like grocery shopping, cooking, cleaning, and laundry.  As if that is not enough he grumbles because he is not getting enough attention in the bedroom. When the couple does spend time together they bicker and snipe at each other constantly.

And I hate to put this negative energy out there because I have read every book, and I do mean every book that Nicholas Sparks has ever written, but I just really disliked this book.It started off in fairly decent fashion, but like some of the other reviews, I found the book dragging on. I understand when you are unhappy in a relationship that your life becomes one big let down.. but I felt the book was like this too. It just had so much negativity for how terrible his marriage was that it made it hard to read. We all read for entertainment or to pass the time... but the book was hard to get through. One thing I will say is that like another review stated, I too disliked the characteristics of the character of Russ. He was spineless at times and I found myself screaming at the book about how he shouldn't let Vivian walk all over him. I wish that there would have been more focus on the development of Emily and his love rather than the let down of his marriage. It badly needed a silver lining. However in true Sparks fashion I did cry at the end of the book and it did evoke emotion within me. But I will say that I will not be re-reading this one. I often find myself re-reading his other works and will continue to do so.... but I would say that this was the worst of the books he has written thus far. I wanted to love this book... but I just had trouble even finishing it. I would agree I too noticed editing errors. I wondered how rushed the book had been to complete.Keep trying Mr. Sparks...

Review.create({ title: "Not Grisham's Best Effort - Boring and Uneven", rating: 3, body: "I am a Grisham fan but this is not his best work.  If there is such a thing, I would call this a boring page-turner. You keep turning the pages expecting it to get better but then you get to the end and realize---that was it.  I mean it has all the nuts and bolts of a solidly written piece of fiction but there is just no spark to it, nothing clever or surprising. After I'd turned all the pages, I blinked several times and turned off my kindle - surprised that it was over because it never quite got off the ground.  The characters are one-dimensional and there is no real connection to them. Like the heroine in Gray Mountain, the female lead in this book is totally vanilla. You're not rooting for her or against her as there is little depth or character development.* some spoilersThe plot is laid out early in the book - there is a corrupt judge colluding with some thugs to skim money at an Indian casino. To expose the corruption, there are a few individuals trying to blow the whistle on the judge to collect cash under the whistle-blower statutes. The whistle-blowers submit a complaint to the agency that investigates rogue judges and an investigation begins. These facts are known early on.  The problem is - that's the entire plot. There are no twists or turns it goes in a fairly straight line from corruption complaint to indictments with few surprises along the way.  There is also a huge loose end as we never find out what happens to one of the characters who was falsely imprisoned for murders he did not commit. Since this character is a main focus in the prequel, the failure to tie up that loose end is irritating.All in all - it is just an uneven effort. A disappointing novel from an author from whom we all expect better.", user_id: user3.id, book_id: book4.id })

When Caesar, a recent arrival from Virginia, tells her about the Underground Railroad, they decide to take a terrifying risk and escape.

Even though Oprah and I have had a tempestuous (albeit one-sided) bookish relationship in the past I thought I'd give this book a try because the slavery era in the US is one of my favorite eras to read about.  It showcases the dichotomy of the indomitable spirit and resilience of human beings despite the most horrific, vile and degrading actions that one person can inflict upon another.Even with all the hype and Oprah's seal of approval I wasn't a fan of this book. There was a lot of good description of the era, some emotional scenes of abuse which are vividly detailed and many diverse characters but it lacked a complexity to the plot and an emotional connection to the characters. Cora, and especially Caesar, felt underdeveloped with their inner feelings muffled to the reader. I also found the flow of the plot to be choppy as readers are repeatedly taken from the main plot into subplots and there were vast sections, mainly towards the end, where the plot would lag and my interest faltered.But my biggest beef has to be the author's fictionalized idea of the Underground Railroad. He described it as an actual subterranean railroad which brought slaves to freedom.  I realize that his concept of the real Underground Railroad was stated on the cover and that it's a historical FICTION read.  But this subway of sorts is too far fetched and I feel that the author took too many liberties moving the book into the historical fantasy genre. My first issue is that it confuses people who already know about the Underground Railroad (I had to reread several sections when it was first introduced because I thought I had misunderstood his intent).Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user7.id, book_id: book5.id })

His latest work, The Underground Railroad which is sharp and ingenious, follows the harrowing plight of Cora who was a young slave on the Randall estate in Georgia. Set around the year 1812, Cora&#8217;s story is all the more heart-wrenching as her mother fled the cotton plantation leaving her behind, to fend for herself. What could have prompted Cora&#8217;s mother to leave her behind is in the realm of speculation. She was never found and successfully dodged the tracker who was assigned to track her down.While it is easy to jump to conclusions and label her as someone shorn of love and affection for Cora, reading about the immense difficulties faced by the slaves on the plantation tempered one&#8217;s judgemental attitude. It was beyond brutal &#8211; the ugly face of inhumanity laid bare. The slaves are subjected to all kinds of cruel and inhumane treatment &#8211; they are whipped, thrashed and raped at the slightest pretext and excuse. And in some instances, just for pure enjoyment and amusement. Public execution was reserved as the harshest punishment, but to many living without dignity and honor was far worse than public execution.The arrival of a new slave, Caesar, brought hope for Cora but it was a daunting one. Author Colson Whitehead masterfully narrated their story and painted a horrific picture of slavery during the period. The character of Cora was well fleshed, and would be hard to forget. The story was well conceived and the secondary characters, especially Caesar, helped to make a solid read. All in all, this is a compelling book which will enable many readers to revisit the past though the manner in which Cora escaped was a bit farfetched.

It&#8217;s pretty hard to put down once you start reading. Whitehead uses metaphor and re-imagines the institution of slavery to convey powerful messages about what it actually means to be in bondage, the pain of being denied a legacy and culture and the complexity of expressing emotions and showing love in a world where your status is always at question. Whitehead uses his writing about the past to make creative connections to current day issues and challenges that we see today.While this book is not meant to teach about the inner workings of underground railroad or the actual differences in the institution of slavery in different states, you can learn to build empathy for the men, women, and children who experienced slavery. If you can&#8217;t do that because you feel like it is too fictional then you are cold-hearted.*Side-note* I am thoroughly confused by people who read this book hoping to learn more about slavery or the underground railroad.

They demand swift action. Dr. Cross is asked to take the job as Chief of Detectives but turns it down. His wife, Bree Stone, accepts the position. This makes for interesting team and family dynamics as they pursue bad guys across the District. Interest grows as the story wades through several subplots. One involves a group of hardcore ex-military vigilantes who take the law into their own hands, another trudges into the manufacture and distribution of dangerous narcotics, and yet another deals with the trafficking and servitude of young European women at an exclusive Washington area resort.  Cross and Stone ferret out the criminal activity with tact and practiced protocols. There is plenty of action with good fight scenes and shootouts.

A feel-good story in the spirit of The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry and Major Pettigrew&#8217;s Last Stand, Fredrik Backman&#8217;s novel about the angry old man next door is a thoughtful exploration of the profound impact one life has on countless others. &#8220;If there was an award for &#8216;Most Charming Book of the Year,&#8217; this first novel by a Swedish blogger-turned-overnight-sensation would win hands down&#8221; (Booklist, starred review).", amazon_link: "https://www.amazon.com/Man-Called-Ove-Novel/dp/1476738025", kobo_link: "https://kobo.com", play_link: "https://play.google.com/store/books" })

It is funny, tender, thoughtful and thought-provoking.  The character of Ove seemed a bit too curmudgeony at first, but as his story unfolded, it all fit.  A touching perspective on loss and what it means to choose life and figure out one's new role as a loner.  It also celebrates the importance of coincidence and embracing what life brings.Laughed out loud and blubbered like a baby--what more can one ask of a book?

Review.create({ title: "A Book for everyone", rating: 5, body: "There is a part of me that didn't think I needed to review A Man Called Ove because so many people have read it at this point, but I have talked to a few who have not, hence my desire to write this review.I will admit that I am entirely on the Ove train!The book is about a man, named Ove, who is the angry neighbor that we all seem to have. He complains about everything, has put up signs around his neighborhood with rules about what should and shouldn't be done, and feels there is a proper place for everything. He is not a friendly guy to say the least.Into his life walks or rather drives a family who are to be his new neighbors. He doesn't bother to get to know their names and calls them the pregnant one and the lanky one. After an accident with the lanky one, Ove is forced to help this family, complaining the entire time.Throughout the book Ove also speaks to his wife, complaining about the neighbors, the rule breakers, and how much he misses her (very minor spoiler). During interludes within the narrative, we read about how Ove became Ove. I will say by the end of the book, a bunch of dust was flying around the room and some got into my eyes.The first thing to write is this book is funny. Ove is quite the character and how he treats people is hysterical. He just doesn't care what he says or how he says it. He simply wants order in his world and has lived that way for all of his life. The way he expresses himself becomes incredibly funny.It is also a tragic story. Backman interweaves the two (funny and tragic) quite well and doesn't make it overly heartwarming. This could have easily become a book with the sentiment that we don't know people's past, so don't judge them, but it isn't. Ove is an ass in his past too and sometimes with reason. Backman keeps it level with just enough to make the reader fall for Ove.The great thing is this is a book that pretty much anyone and everyone can (and will) enjoy. I recommended this one for book clubs and discussion groups. Grandmas will like this as well as middle aged men. Ove is simply a good book.I gave this one 5 stars.", user_id: user2.id, book_id: book8.id })

I was born and raised in Finland, so I know something about the people described in this book and what makes them tick, or explode, for that matter.The story follows Ove, a curmudgeon and an introvert, who goes through his life in a non-descript housing development, following his own strict rules of proper and orderly behavior.  The writing is at times brilliant and at times tedious.  The plot plods along, often circling back to itself for totally unnecessary repetitions, which start feeling like annoying page fillers without purpose.  The endless discussions about car ownership, what kind of people drive Saabs vs. Volvos, and what are the pros and cons of each, are funny for the first time but extremely tedious when repeated ad nauseum.  And the same goes for the small supporting cast of characters.Why this book is so popular and well received is beyond me, but then again I didn't think much of the Norwegian bestseller &#34;My Struggle,&#34;  so maybe its just me.  The story is so predictable that after the first 20-30 pages I knew what was going to happen and how it was going to end.  There were some pleasant surprises sprinkled in, but they couldn't carry the story on their own.It is unfortunate that books like this are defining non-Scandinavians' view of what light-hearted and humoristic Scandinavian literature is all about, just like the endless and extremely graphic serial murderer mysteries have come to define Scandinavian crime mystery genre.  There is a wealth of much better constructed and written books being published in Scandinavia these days that are much better representatives of excellent Scandinavian/Nordic literature that don't have follow the moody, dark, hopeless storylines that have dominated Nordic literature in the past.A Man Named Ove is a good effort, but to me as a lover of Scandinavian literature it was definitely a disappointment.", user_id: user4.id, book_id: book8.id })

Review.create({ title: "Baffled by Its Success", rating: 2, body: "I think I would ordinarily cut this book more of a break because it is fast-paced - Hawkins wastes zero time describing anything that doesn't have to do with exactly what is going on in the moment - and while that doesn't make her a great writer, there is absolutely nothing here that will transcend, or reverberate within you long after you've finished reading - it at least doesn't bog you down with preciousness. But because the book has received so many rave reviews - I have to judge it more harshly because it just isn't deserved. This is serviceable writing at best - about the level you'd read on Fiction Press - about the level you would get from a first year MFA student. If someone is digging around in something, they are 'scrabbling' (over and over). The lead character's blackouts are along the lines of: &#34;I couldn't remember. It was all dark. All black. All cloudy. Couldn't remember.&#34; I'm making that up, but it's not significantly different. So, that's the writing, let's get to the plot.The book is told from the POV of three different female characters, none of them compelling in the slightest. We're supposed to care deeply that a woman who chronically cheats on her husband disappears. I really didn't care that she did, frankly. Then we're supposed to care that Rachel, who drinks too much on the train while she pretends to commute to a job she doesn't have and obsesses about her ex-husband and her 'barren womb', may or may not have witnessed a crime. I didn't care about Rachel, didn't care about the woman who'd gone MIA. Now let's get to the third character you can't care about - Anna. I don't even remember her place in the story I cared about her so little.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user1.id, book_id: book10.id })

They've recently had a child which is something Rachel was unable to produce when she was married to him.  He's moved his new family into the home that he and Rachel once shared. Tom posted a picture of himself and his newborn on Facebook with the caption that he's never been happier.Rachel, in her despondency, has taken to drinking to a point where she has blackouts and forgets that she drunk calls her husband many times a night, even shows up at his home.

Megan and Anna look enough alike that the police feel there may be mistaken identity involved.The book is told in three voices: Rachel, Megan and Anna.

Review.create({ title: "ALCOHOLIC AMNESIA", rating: 4, body: "THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN is a dark, haunting and depressing psychological thriller, but it's incredibly effective thanks to the writing skills of author Paula Hawkins.  Rachel is a divorced woman who would do anything for a drink, and like a lot of folks consumed by a love affair with the bottle, one might call her a victim of circumstances.  Her husband Tom had an affair that resulted in a pregnancy.  He divorced Rachel, married the other woman and now all three (husband, wife and child) are happily ensconced in the house that was once Rachel's.The train that Rachel rides to London each day takes her past her old neighborhood.  From the window of the train she observes not only her old garden that backs up to the tracks, but also the daily activities of another couple who reside down the street from her previous home.  In her imagination she has given the couple names and has created a fairy tale love life for them. Real life, however, cannot live up to her fantasy and the couple does not have the picture perfect relationship that Rachel has concocted.  When a murder occurs, Rachel becomes entangled in the investigation because of what she has witnessed on her daily commute.This rather bleak story with intersecting timelines is told from the viewpoint of three different women Rachel, Anne and Megan.  All the women are unreliable narrators with something to hide.  In fact, most of the characters in this novel, including the men, lack veracity, and are a self-serving and unsympathetic group with plenty of skeletons in their closets.Lest I continue and divulge too much of the plot, let me just say that the twists and turns in the story are many and readers will be easily drawn in, making it easy to devour this book in one afternoon.", user_id: user8.id, book_id: book10.id })

Otherwise every other somewhat original idea he presents is too mystical and too irrational to even be accepted as truth, such as his ridiculous notion of a Personal Legend motivated by the Soul of the Universe. Rather than The Alchemist conveying any true wisdom, it feels as if it is Coelho's dumping ground of his underdeveloped musings on life.  Although he does attempt to provide a new insight into life with each new person Santiago meets, he should instead had each person teach Santiago a completely different lesson regarding different aspects of life. Then these lessons could have all merged to create something vaguely resembling an epiphany. Instead, Coelho tried to make every new companion relate to an overlying soul of the universe theory.

The decline of this group, a demographic of our country that has been slowly disintegrating over forty years, has been reported on with growing frequency and alarm, but has never before been written about as searingly from the inside. J. D. Vance tells the true story of what a social, regional, and class decline feels like when you were born with it hung around your neck.The Vance family story begins hopefully in postwar America. J. D.&#8217;s grandparents were &#8220;dirt poor and in love,&#8221; and moved north from Kentucky&#8217;s Appalachia region to Ohio in the hopes of escaping the dreadful poverty around them. They raised a middle-class family, and eventually their grandchild (the author) would graduate from Yale Law School, a conventional marker of their success in achieving generational upward mobility.But as the family saga of&#160;Hillbilly Elegy&#160;plays out, we learn that this is only the short, superficial version. Vance&#8217;s grandparents, aunt, uncle, sister, and, most of all, his mother, struggled profoundly with the demands of their new middle-class life, and were never able to fully escape the legacy of abuse, alcoholism, poverty, and trauma so characteristic of their part of America. Vance piercingly shows how he himself still carries around the demons of their chaotic family history.A deeply moving memoir with its share of humor and vividly colorful figures,&#160;Hillbilly Elegy&#160;is the story of how upward mobility really feels. And it is an urgent and troubling meditation on the loss of the American dream for a large segment of this country.", amazon_link: "https://www.amazon.com/Hillbilly-Elegy-Memoir-Family-Culture/dp/0062300547", kobo_link: "https://kobo.com", play_link: "https://play.google.com/store/books" })

I agree with his conclusion that no government program will stop the continuing cycle of drugs, poverty, teen pregnancy, and the feeling of hopelessness these people have. The cycle repeats from generation to generation with no end in sight. Vance was the exception in finding a way out, largely through the love, guidance and encouragement of his grandmother. She also kept him away from the wrong kind of friends. Very few children in his situation are as lucky. But there also had to be something inside himself that helped him escape. I thought initially that there would be a lot of political bias in his story but there was remarkably little.&#34;People sometimes ask whether I think there&#8217;s anything we can do to &#8220;solve&#8221; the problems of my community.

It is a life on the very edge of plausibility, without the sense of extra-family community that serves as a stabilizing agent in many first-generation immigrant communities or communities of color. Drugs, crime, jail time, abusive interactions without any knowledge of other forms of interaction, children growing up in a wild mix of stoned mother care, foster care, and care by temporary &#34;boyfriends,&#34; and in general, an image of life on the edge of survival where even the heroes are distinctly flawed for lack of knowledge and experience of any other way of living.This is a story that many of the &#34;upwardly mobile middle class&#34; in the coastal areas, often so quick to judge the lifestyles and politics of &#34;those people&#34; in middle America, has no clue about. I speak from experience as someone that grew up in the heartland but has spent years in often elite circles on either coast.Two things struck me most about this book.First, the unflinching yet not judgmental portrayal of the circumstances and of the people involved. It is difficult to write on this subject without either glossing over the ugliness and making warm and fuzzy appeals to idealism and human nature, Hollywood style, or without on the other hand descending into attempts at political persuasion and calls to activism. This book manages to paint the picture, in deeply moving ways, without committing either sin, to my eye.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user3.id, book_id: book13.id })

He suggests that tribalism, mistrust of outsiders and &#34;elites,&#34; violence and irresponsibility among family members, parents without ethics and a sense of responsibility, terrible work ethics, and an us-against-them mentality is dooming the people who live that way to becoming poorer, more addicted, and more marginalized.

Review.create({ title: "True Story", rating: 4, body: "The first thing you should know, if you happen to be a Star Wars fan and are expecting a tale of romance between Han Solo and Princess Leia, you will be disappointed.  This is a rather unromantic account of a 3 month affair between two co-stars who were attracted to each other: one a stoic, complicated, reserved married father of 2 just starting to realize his dreams of making it big, and the other, a vivacious, emotionally inexperienced 19 year old woman with a big personality wanting to start her life as an adult.  Trouble is, she doesn't know how to handle it.  And his way of handling it is to be unemotional and silent.************The Following May Contain Details***************************************************The first part of the book is written in Carrie's chatty, charming, self-depreciating style as she tells of her early life working as a backup singer in her mother's variety show.  Father is absent, having left mother for Elizabeth Taylor (and Carrie manages to throw a few zinger his way as well.)  She takes us through the auditions for both Star Wars and the movie Carrie right up through how she chose that cinnamon bun hairstyle.  As for as a behind-the-scenes look at the movie, that's about it.  The rest is her account as that vulnerable 19 year old with the witty mouth who exudes faked confidence, who decided that she was going to have an affair on the movie set.  No married men, thank you very much, especially that intense, quiet, but gorgeous co-star.  Not like he'd ever go for someone like her, anyway, right?  All too soon, she's left wondering at what the gorgeous stranger in her bed is doing with the likes of her.  And so ensues a 3 month secret affair conducted during the weekends, between two people who are at very different places in their lives..There are no explicit details, just a couple of conversations..  (No, she never critiques his technique as a lover..)  And you don't get his side of the story, of course, because this is based on her own recollections and some diaries she found when renovating her bedroom.  The diary section is raw and painful and messy and sad and wounded as one might expect a young woman's recollections to be over a doomed affair.  She writes many poems, songs, and prose on her feelings of the situation and does not hold back.  Around him, she finds herself self-conscious and nervous.  She laments that they have no feeling for each other, that he should have stayed a stranger, that he's unemotional, silent, the MarlboroMan, boring, two-dimentional, quiet, and she's falling in love and falling apart.  She has already established that she's insecure (most people I know are insecure - me included) and young (rather unworldly and a bit naive as 19 year olds tend to be), so mix that with a grown man who is emotionally unavailable, and this is what you get.Side Commentary:Did he know she felt this way, or did he not?  Hard to say because neither of them were talking about their feelings with each other, but if he did I would imagine he did not want to encourage her, as he was married and had a family, and knew where this would lead.  Given the fact that this lasted 3 months, I can't imagine he had no feelings about it, even if he didn't show them (it's a well-known and often told fact that Harrison took drama classes in college to overcome his shyness.  Or maybe he's introverted.  Or maybe he's just a guy.  Who knows?)  Maybe he felt guilty, not just for cheating, not just for his wife, but for Carrie as well, for embarking on a 'casual' affair that turned out to not be so 'casual' afterall.  Something done in theory is always different in fact.And another thing:The stuff Carrie writes in her journal reads like an exposed nerve, but it's the stuff she's thinking and feeling - the angsty kind of stuff you write in a diary - not the stuff you share with a guy, especially one who's married (so maybe he didn't know, but I'm still betting he did.)  I'm sure most of you know that this is how women are - if you pass us in the hall at school and say 'hi', we're already wondering if this is the story we'll tell at our engagement party, of how we first met.  We get melodramatic;  It's just what we do.It did not end badly - it just ended (with a bit of relief and no regret.)The last part of the book fast-forwards 40 years.  She writes that she knows Harrison better now and he still leaves her tongue-tied.  If she was not proud of herself for having an affair with a married man (as she writes), I can only imagine he was not proud of himself either. (Also, she mentions that he is not a womanizer, and as far as she knows, she was his only affair and he was faithful to his other wives.)  And they've never mentioned it since.  Until now.So why tell this story at all?  Well, Carrie found those diaries and began reading them, remembering that time in her life fondly, even gratefully.  As we get older, remembering a time in our lives when everything was in front of us, when we were young and relevent and everything is new, becomes important (she writes this in different words.)  And she loves being Princess Leia, and is proud of it.  She says and writes that she has no desire to embarrass Harrison or hurt anyone with this old story, and she did call him and talk with him about it.  He didn't object or ask her to change anything.  This did not happen yesterday - it happened 40 years ago.  To read the diaries of the naive girl you were at 19 from the perspective of an older, wiser 60 year old is surreal.  I keep diaries, too, and, while I've never had an affair with Harrison Ford (darn!  and I'm not near 60 yet), I'm still shocked at the angst and drama of my former self, and what a particular situation meant to me and how it's shaped me.  This is something Carrie wanted to share because she found those diaries and it's a part of the history of that time in their lives, and because and she can look back on it now in a different way (time has a way of taking the sting out of such things.).And it's important to note that this is from her point of view as a 19 year old girl/woman - not now, who didn't understand that there are no such things as 'no-strings-attached' affairs.  I'm betting Harrison learned that too.", user_id: user8.id, book_id: book14.id })

Nevertheless I have read several of his &#8220;killing book series,&#8221; and I have found them invariably superficial in depth but otherwise well-written and interesting &#8212; written in accordance with marketing techniques for popular, best selling books. &#8220;Killing the Rising Sun: How America Vanquished World War II Japan&#8221; is no different, but it&#8217;s arguably better, if not the best of those I have read so far in the series. The reason for this is perhaps that O&#8217;Reilly is not dealing with a controversial subject, and is free to narrate history with suspense while propounding his usual winning and acceptable populist viewpoint with little risk of possibly offending propriety or violating taboos. This happened very successfully with his book on &#8220;Killing Kennedy.&#8221; With &#8220;Killing Jesus&#8221; he was careful to remain confined in his narrative within the acceptable know facts surrounding the &#8220;historical Jesus&#8221; without theological speculation, and without advancing any new biblical theories or launching new historical research.Second, if you have enjoyed his previous books you will love this one. In this new book, the Japanese are clearly the bad guys for triggering the war in a treacherous and infamous fashion at Pearl Harbor, and O&#8217;Reilly is free to engage in unhindered patriotism,  and supportive of whatever blow America intended and delivered to the vanquished Japanese.  And thus unhindered in his point of view and on the right side of history,  O&#8217;Reilly and Dugald have written a basic but very interesting account of how &#8220;America killed the Rising Sun.&#8221; There are not, and the reader should not expect, any, new revelations.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user2.id, book_id: book15.id })

Unlike the earlier titles in the series which focused on the violent death of famous personalities, in this book the authors have shifted their attention not just to one nation but two caught in the throes of a devastating war.Killing the Rising Sun chronicled the violence and destruction as it was witnessed in the mid-1940s, and covers the War in the Pacific beginning in 1944, culminating with the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. It was unprecedented. This retelling of history will put the events in its true perspective, and help readers better understand America and the world. The authors have done a splendid job by writing the events that unfolded as seen through the eyes of such figures as Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Gen. Douglas MacArthur, Harry Truman, Emperor Hirohito, and Robert Oppenheimer.Killing the Rising Sun: How America Vanquished World War II Japan by Fox News host Bill O'Reilly and Martin Dugard is another scorcher not to be missed.", user_id: user14.id, book_id: book15.id })

These famous words are now synonymous with the dynamic husband-and-wife team Chip and Joanna Gaines, stars of HGTV&rsquo;s Fixer Upper. As this question fills the airwaves with anticipation, their legions of fans continue to multiply and ask a different series of questions, like&mdash;Who are these people?What&rsquo;s the secret to their success? And is Chip actually that funny in real life? By renovating homes in Waco, Texas, and changing lives in such a winsome and engaging way, Chip and Joanna have become more than just the stars of Fixer Upper, they have become America&rsquo;s new best friends. The Magnolia Story is the first book from Chip and Joanna, offering their fans a detailed look at their life together. From the very first renovation project they ever tackled together, to the project that nearly cost them everything; from the childhood memories that shaped them, to the twists and turns that led them to the life they share on the farm today. They both attended Baylor University in Waco. However, their paths did not cross until Chip checked his car into the local Firestone tire shop where Joanna worked behind the counter. Even back then Chip was a serial entrepreneur who, among other things, ran a lawn care company, sold fireworks, and flipped houses. Soon they were married and living in their first fixer upper. Four children and countless renovations later, Joanna garners the attention of a television producer who notices her work on a blog one day. In The Magnolia Story fans will finally get to join the Gaines behind the scenes and discover:  The time Chip ran to the grocery store and forgot to take their new, sleeping baby Joanna&rsquo;s agonizing decision to close her dream business to focus on raising their children When Chip buys a houseboat, sight-unseen, and it turns out to be a leaky wreck Joanna&rsquo;s breakthrough moment of discovering the secret to creating a beautiful home Harrowing stories of the financial ups and downs as an entrepreneurial couple Memories and photos from Chip and Jo&rsquo;s wedding The significance of the word magnolia and why it permeates everything they do The way the couple pays the popularity of Fixer Upper forward, sharing the success with others, and bolstering the city of Waco along the way  And yet there is still one lingering question for fans of the show: Is Chip really that funny? &ldquo;Oh yeah,&rdquo; says Joanna. &ldquo;He was, and still is, my first fixer upper.&rdquo;", amazon_link: "https://www.amazon.com/Magnolia-Story-Chip-Gaines/dp/0718079183", kobo_link: "https://kobo.com", play_link: "https://play.google.com/store/books" })

Their papers showed the ways in which the human mind erred, systematically, when forced to make judgments in uncertain situations. Their work created the field of behavioral economics, revolutionized Big Data studies, advanced evidence-based medicine, led to a new approach to government regulation, and made much of Michael Lewis&#x2019;s own work possible. Kahneman and Tversky are more responsible than anybody for the powerful trend to mistrust human intuition and defer to algorithms.The Undoing Project is about a compelling collaboration between two men who have the dimensions of great literary figures. They became heroes in the university and on the battlefield&#x2015;both had important careers in the Israeli military&#x2015;and their research was deeply linked to their extraordinary life experiences. Amos Tversky was a brilliant, self-confident warrior and extrovert, the center of rapt attention in any room; Kahneman, a fugitive from the Nazis in his childhood, was an introvert whose questing self-doubt was the seedbed of his ideas. They became one of the greatest partnerships in the history of science, working together so closely that they couldn&#x2019;t remember whose brain originated which ideas, or who should claim credit. They flipped a coin to decide the lead authorship on the first paper they wrote, and simply alternated thereafter.This story about the workings of the human mind is explored through the personalities of two fascinating individuals so fundamentally different from each other that they seem unlikely friends or colleagues. In the process they may well have changed, for good, mankind&#x2019;s view of its own mind.", amazon_link: "https://www.amazon.com/Undoing-Project-Friendship-Changed-Minds/dp/0393254593", kobo_link: "https://kobo.com", play_link: "https://play.google.com/store/books" })

The Undoing Project is the epic story of how it all came to be.It is a story that only Michael Lewis could write. With his characteristic accessibility and knack for turning the complex into palatable pieces, Lewis presents the foundations of the science by crafting a story about its two visionary scholars, Daniel Kahneman and the late Amos Tversky.In so doing, Lewis gives a face to the theories and ideas that we have all become so aware of in the last ten or fifteen years: The Anchoring Effect, Framing, Overconfidence Bias, Regression to the Mean, Halo Effect. These and other &#8220;cognitive biases&#8221; have become familiar scientific concepts.

The beauty of what is now called &#8220;Prospect Theory&#8221; has inevitably stuck with me since.  It is only in retrospect that I have come to understand it was radical for its time.So I swallowed whole &#8220;Thinking About Thinking&#8221; within a week of having read the Michael Lewis review on Bloomberg.  And I&#8217;ve since really enjoyed the recent near-autobiography of Richard Thaler&#8217;s, as well as many of Dan Ariely&#8217;s books.Well, you don&#8217;t have to believe me on this, but Michael Lewis actually explains the concepts better!No joke, he really does.And he provides an unbelievably deep, personal and sensitive account of the explosive relationship between the two giants.  A very believable account too.  The research done by Michael Lewis really shows.  He&#8217;s had phenomenal access too, it seems.And yet, the book does not hang together terribly well.  Chapters 1 and 8 should not have made it into the book, they ought to have been relegated to the pages of Vanity Fair, where the author regularly provides fantastic material.More to the point, what we have here is a bunch of chapters that, chronological order notwithstanding, do not constitute a book.  The incredible material, the wonderful expositions, the deep insights are all present and correct, but they fail to meld into a narrative.

The book moves at a brisk pace, never dull, and fleshes out the men behind the scientific work.  This vantage point into where Kahneman and Tversky came from, the events that shaped them, their intellectual make-ups, and the alchemy of their partnership is a real treat.  This added depth to the scientists only makes me appreciate their work all the more.

A five-hundred-year-old legend. An ancient curse. A stunning medical mystery. And a pioneering journey into the unknown heart of the world's densest jungle.Since the days of conquistador Hern&#xE1;n Cort&#xE9;s, rumors have circulated about a lost city of immense wealth hidden somewhere in the Honduran interior, called the White City or the Lost City of the Monkey God. Indigenous tribes speak of ancestors who fled there to escape the Spanish invaders, and they warn that anyone who enters this sacred city will fall ill and die. In 1940, swashbuckling journalist Theodore Morde returned from the rainforest with hundreds of artifacts and an electrifying story of having found the Lost City of the Monkey God-but then committed suicide without revealing its location.Three quarters of a century later, bestselling author Doug Preston joined a team of scientists on a groundbreaking new quest. In 2012 he climbed aboard a rickety, single-engine plane carrying the machine that would change everything: lidar, a highly advanced, classified technology that could map the terrain under the densest rainforest canopy. In an unexplored valley ringed by steep mountains, that flight revealed the unmistakable image of a sprawling metropolis, tantalizing evidence of not just an undiscovered city but an enigmatic, lost civilization.Venturing into this raw, treacherous, but breathtakingly beautiful wilderness to confirm the discovery, Preston and the team battled torrential rains, quickmud, disease-carrying insects, jaguars, and deadly snakes. But it wasn't until they returned that tragedy struck: Preston and others found they had contracted in the ruins a horrifying, sometimes lethal-and incurable-disease.Suspenseful and shocking, filled with colorful history, hair-raising adventure, and dramatic twists of fortune, THE LOST CITY OF THE MONKEY GOD is the absolutely true, eyewitness account of one of the great discoveries of the twenty-first century.", amazon_link: "https://www.amazon.com/Lost-City-Monkey-God-Story/dp/1455540005", kobo_link: "https://kobo.com", play_link: "https://play.google.com/store/books" })

I realize I'm being naive in this regard but I had hoped that the scholarly community wouldn't be so politically aligned.Another aspect of the book I found interesting was the possible reasons the ancient cities were abandoned. The fierce spread of disease introduced by European explorers and it's incredible rate of spread. Also interesting was the possible reasons for the different reasons disease developed so differently in the old and new world's.Finally, the evolution of ancient disease into modern disease and it's potential affect on our global society.All of these things were so amazingly well covered.

According to historian Joseph Ellis,&#160;Alexander Hamilton&#160;is &ldquo;a robust full-length portrait, in my view the best ever written, of the most brilliant, charismatic and dangerous founder of them all.&rdquo;Few figures in American history have been more hotly debated or more grossly misunderstood than Alexander Hamilton. Chernow&rsquo;s biography gives Hamilton his due and sets the record straight, deftly illustrating that the political and economic greatness of today&rsquo;s America is the result of Hamilton&rsquo;s countless sacrifices to champion ideas that were often wildly disputed during his time. &ldquo;To repudiate his legacy,&rdquo; Chernow writes, &ldquo;is, in many ways, to repudiate the modern world.&rdquo; Chernow here recounts Hamilton&rsquo;s turbulent life: an illegitimate, largely self-taught orphan from the Caribbean, he came out of nowhere to take America by storm, rising to become George Washington&rsquo;s aide-de-camp in the Continental Army, coauthoring The Federalist Papers, founding the Bank of New York, leading the Federalist Party, and becoming the first Treasury Secretary of the United States.Historians have long told the story of America&rsquo;s birth as the triumph of Jefferson&rsquo;s democratic ideals over the aristocratic intentions of Hamilton. Chernow presents an entirely different man, whose legendary ambitions were motivated not merely by self-interest but by passionate patriotism and a stubborn will to build the foundations of American prosperity and power. His is a Hamilton far more human than we&rsquo;ve encountered before&mdash;from his shame about his birth to his fiery aspirations, from his intimate relationships with childhood friends to his titanic feuds with Jefferson, Madison, Adams, Monroe, and Burr, and from his highly public affair with Maria Reynolds to his loving marriage to his loyal wife Eliza. And never before has there been a more vivid account of Hamilton&rsquo;s famous and mysterious death in a duel with Aaron Burr in July of 1804.Chernow&rsquo;s biography is not just a portrait of Hamilton, but the story of America&rsquo;s birth seen through its most central figure. At a critical time to look back to our roots,&#160;Alexander Hamilton&#160;will remind readers of the purpose of our institutions and our heritage as Americans.&ldquo;Nobody has captured Hamilton better than Chernow&rdquo;&#160;&mdash;The New York Times Book Review&#160;", amazon_link: "https://www.amazon.com/Alexander-Hamilton-Ron-Chernow/dp/0143034758", kobo_link: "https://kobo.com", play_link: "https://play.google.com/store/books" })

When I heard of Hamilton on Broadway, I immediately got myself tickets and started rereading this gem of a book. Hamilton's life is like a movie, full of trials and tribulations, drama and chock full of accomplishments. I don't think Hamilton gets the credit he deserves. He basically founded the principles modern America is based on, granted he built his model borrowing from ideas from other places but it's still a marvel. He was astute enough to see that the U.S would be a capitalist nation versus Jefferson's favored agrarian society. Mr. Chernow does a brilliant job of chronicling his life from his humble beginnings to the end of his life after his duel with Burr.

Review.create({ title: "Historical Perspective and Compelling Style", rating: 5, body: "Current political debates, ubiquitous in the news, are put into historical perspective by reading this book. Documents like the Constitution, and federal government powers to tax and regulate, were not taken for granted at the outset; and political differences of opinion were not merely debated but were settled by means as extreme as dueling to the death.Alexander Hamilton was probably the most significant Founding Father who was never elected to the Presidency (all right, maybe Franklin too).  His life, while truncated, put him at the forefront of all the issues of early day America. Perhaps the reason this book is fascinates me is because it presents each issue both from Hamilton’s viewpoint and from his opponents’ viewpoints; and often there was compelling logic on both sides. For example, should the debts incurred by the individual states in fighting the Revolutionary War be paid off by the federal government? On the one hand, the victory benefitted the whole country, and individual state taxes would conflict with federal taxing powers; but on the other, some of the states had already done a good job of paying down their debts on their own. Also of interest was the difference in perspective between Hamilton’s dream of America as a manufacturing powerhouse and a strong united nation, versus Jefferson’s as an agrarian society with emphasis on states’ rights. Hamilton set up a logical monetary system that would be a foundation for long-term economic strength to the nation, but there were reasons for people to mistrust it (and him, as a result). Disputes between major players were often philosophical, but sometimes personal events got entangled too. This book really fills in the gaps in understanding American history but manages to be much more interesting than the history books I was required to read as a young student.

System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical. The impact of overconfidence on corporate strategies, the difficulties of predicting what will make us happy in the future, the profound effect of cognitive biases on everything from playing the stock market to planning our next vacation&#x2015;each of these can be understood only by knowing how the two systems shape our judgments and decisions.Engaging the reader in a lively conversation about how we think, Kahneman reveals where we can and cannot trust our intuitions and how we can tap into the benefits of slow thinking.

Not only do we mis-assess situations, but we do so following fairly predictable patterns. Moreover, those patterns are grounded in our primate ancestry.The first observation, giving the title to the book, is that eons of natural selection gave us the ability to make a fast reaction to a novel situation. Survival depended on it. So, if we hear an unnatural noise in the bushes, our tendency is to run. Thinking slow, applying human logic, we might reflect that it is probably Johnny coming back from the Girl Scout camp across the river bringing cookies, and that running might not be the best idea. However, fast thinking is hardwired.The first part of the book is dedicated to a description of the two systems, the fast and slow system. Kahneman introduces them in his first chapter as system one and system two.Chapter 2 talks about the human energy budget. Thinking is metabolically expensive; 20 percent of our energy intake goes to the brain. Moreover, despite what your teenager tells you, dedicating energy to thinking about one thing means that energy is not available for other things. Since slow thinking is expensive, the body is programmed to avoid it.Chapter 3 expands on this notion of the lazy controller. We don't invoke our slow thinking, system two machinery unless it is needed. It is expensive. As an example, try multiplying two two-digit numbers in your head while you are running. You will inevitably slow down.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user4.id, book_id: book20.id })

More specifically, the two systems (fast and slow), basically how you suck at thinking, and finally 'the two selves.' Technically, the book is broken up into five parts - two systems, heuristics & biases, overconfidence, choices, and finally the two selves.Page 20 starts off his quick definitions of the two systems. System 1 is automatic and works quickly with little to no effort. System 2 'allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it' and this usually requires concentration and can be interrupted and disrupted.The middle three sections could possibly be rearranged but essentially include research biases, design, and problems (fallacies, sample size issues, etc.). This part of the book will blow your mind. It is unbelievable some of the things that affect research, especially anchoring. It should make you terrified to ever go before a judge.Finally, the two selves. This is basically the self that exists (or existed, experienced something) and the 'remembering' self, not necessarily what happened, but what you remember happening. The implications of these two differing selves have far reaching affects. As an example, researchers had two groups of people that underwent a procedure. One group experienced the procedure and long with a high peak of pain, and then slowly fading out. The other group had a shorter experience, but didn't fade as much, but also didn't peak as much.The participants rated pain levels during the event.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user8.id, book_id: book20.id })

BE SKEPTICAL ANYWAY.", rating: 5, body: "Back in 1994, Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini, Director of the Institute of San Raffaele in Milan, Italy, wrote a charming little book about common cognitive distortions called Inevitable Illusions. It is probably the very first comprehensive summary of behavioral economics intended for general audience. In it, he predicted that the two psychologists behind behavioral economics - Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman - would win the Nobel prize. I didn't disagree with the sentiment, but wondered how in the world were they going to get it since these two were psychologists and there is no Nobel prize in psychology. I didn't think there was much chance of them winning the Nobel Prize in economics. I was wrong and Piattelli-Palmarini was right. Kahneman won the Nobel prize in Economic Sciences. (Tversky unfortunately prematurely passed away by this time.) Just as Steve Jobs who was not in the music industry revolutionized it, the non-economists Kahneman and Tversky have revolutionized economic thinking. I have known Kahneman's work for quite some time and was quite excited to see that he was coming out with a non-technical version of his research. My expectations for the book were high and I wasn't disappointed.Since other reviewers have given an excellent summary of the book, I will be brief in my summary but review the book more broadly.The basis thesis of the book is simple. In judging the world around us, we use two mental systems: Fast and Slow.  The Fast system (System 1) is mostly unconscious and makes snap judgments based on our past experiences and emotions. When we use this system we are as likely to be wrong as right. The Slow system (System 2) is rational, conscious and slow. They work together to provide us a view of the world around us.So what's the problem?Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user9.id, book_id: book20.id })

Review.create({ title: "A people pleaser for the masses", rating: 3, body: "I usually love all the books I read since I am very selective. However this was a let down for a number of reasons:1. While it started off strongly, it rapidly fell off in all aspects about a third in. The writing was less to the point, the points were less groundbreaking, and seemed to be supported by rather anecdotal observations. It had a comeback here and there, but the majority of the book as weak imo.2. Overdone storytelling. About 1/5th of the book is spent on a chapter on plane crashes. He makes a very smart and interesting point, but that point was made after about 30 minutes, yet he kept going bringing example after example in excruciating detail. This is closely related to point 1 as it appears that as substance decreased, the exposition of description increased.3. His stance is too extreme. If the tale of the self made man is one extreme, then outliers is the other extreme as it basically attempts to discredit the successful and say it was all due to luck. He keeps mentioning Bill Gates and how &#34;lucky&#34; he was to have a computer in his school. He also mentions that there were only a handful of school at the time to have such a computer. Well a handful of schools say 12? With say 1000 students on average each? That means 12,000 others had the same chance as him. 12,000 that did not program all night long, to learn this new skill, but rather chose to play ball or worry about boys/girls. While we can discredit everyone by the logic of &#34;if X did not happen, he would not have accomplished Y&#34;, the truth is this Malcolm: We are around so much opportunity, more so now than ever, that it's less a question of whether there is opportunity, nut whether we take advantage of it. You are correct that now I'd have a harder time creating my own operating system, that ship has sailed, I agree, but that is looking at success with a very narrow lense. There is always an opportune industry for one to break into, and all it takes is seizing those opportunities. As with your mother, you mention in the Epilogue, if it were not for someone having given her money to go to school, things would have been very different. Don't you think that is selling her short? I'm sure she would have kept asking until she found someone else to give her money.The true story of success is that successful people will not let their story be changed by adding or removing a variable from their path, they will keep fighting and find something to replace that variable. That's why some of the most successful people have been declined or faced defeat (be it investors, agents, etc.) over a hundred times and kept going. If you'd go back and take away their investor, its safe to say they would have kept going to another 100 and eventually found someone else. And that attitude, as you may claim, is not a stone cold result of legacy, as both those born of a privileged background as well as those with the most painful of pasts have those attitudes... because an attitude is decided in the moment, not something we are born with or given.In conclusion, it is an interesting read if you want to learn more about people, but take it with a grain of salt. This is NOT personal development, or anything of the sort in case you think this is a book I read and learn to be successful... quite contrary the message appears to comfort those that don't have success and blame society, and poke those with success implying that whatever they have was not earned.", user_id: user1.id, book_id: book21.id })
Review.create({ title: "Parent or Not to Parent", rating: 5, body: "Reading Gladwell is like arguing with yourself.  In so many of his books I find myself in a knee jerk denial  with his initial assertions, only to acquiesce, if not completely at least by a measurable amount.  One thing I will say about Outliers is that, while Gladwell doesn't come out and promote it this way, the information in the book is tremendous for parents such as myself.  Specific scenes in the book almost encourage you to get more active in your childrens' lives immediately.  I agree with the premise of the book to a point.  While I believe that environment and date of birth, surrounding influences and circumstances play a tremendous role in the development of an individual, I also believe the individual has some control over several of these factors.  By emphasizing the importance of circumstance Gladwell encouraged me to pay more attention to my &#34;surroundings&#34; and try to find ways to influence those which I could control so that those circumstances could in turn benefit me, family, friends, associates, and on and on.  I disagree that if more kids had access to computers at the same time Bill Gates had access then we would have thousands of Microsofts.  I believe we could possible have many more computer programmers and professionals as well as a few more operating systems but there has always been and there will always be the exceptions (outliers) on both ends of the spectrum.  If the outlier was not Bill Gates with his computer time then it would have been somebody else with his/her computer time and another factor.  I call it the &#34;plus 1 effect.&#34;Acknowledging while refraining from complete buy in on the premise, I consider this a must read book especially for parents.

Each chapter pulled you deeper into the story and plot.  The one thing I wasn’t a fan of in this book, is that it was very difficult to follow along or understand. Don’t get me wrong I loved the individuality of each chapter, but in a regular story each chapter tells you more about the characters and setting. On the other hand Outliers is a completely different concept. The story can be very hard to follow and understand at times, when it jumps from story to story. You may misunderstand a sentence or two and have to go back and read it over again. I certainly did.  Now this book is not for everyone, what book is, but I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes non-fictional books, or to anyone looking for a deep read.

With dazzling candor, legal scholar Michelle Alexander argues that we have not ended racial caste in America; we have merely redesigned it.

Review.create({ title: "Don't read Coates' book - read this one!", rating: 5, body: "If you really want to know the extent of white privilege and how it survives given that most Americans are not outwardly racist anymore, this is the book for you. As Michelle Alexander points out in great detail, white privilege exists today in America in the form of mass incarceration, the generic term for the fact that despite being a supposedly &#34;free&#34; country, we manage to imprison more of our citizens than any other country on earth, even Russia or China.  But more than that, a very high percentage of these people are black, and in fact they go to prison at a rate disproportionate to the frequency with which they commit crimes. To be blunt, if you are caught selling illegal drugs in most states, you are likely to go to prison if you are black, but you will more likely get treated more leniently if you are white.  It's worse than that, because, unlike most other developed nations, we make certain that once someone is convicted of a felony, he loses the vote, his right to public housing, the ability to get a job, in other words, he can be discriminated against for life.  But he committed the crime so he deserves it, right?  Not so fast - whereas whites commit many crimes at the same rate as blacks or even higher, especially drug crimes, they go to prison much less often.  Blacks have to be perfect - dot their i's and cross all their t's.  It's not realistic, and it's unfair.Alexander points out that this is nothing more than a new system to marginalize and discriminate against blacks, and calls it &#34;the new Jim Crow&#34;.  If anything, it's more accurate to call it the new slavery.  Just go to Angola State Prison in Louisiana and watch all the black prisoners working in the cotton fields.  Look familiar?  Now how did this happen?  How did the number of Americans behind bars go from 350,000 (still a high number) to over 2 million in the last 30-40 years?  A large part of it was the War on Drugs, started by Nixon around 1970.  Alexander traces the history of the drug war, and describes how it became a vehicle for mistreating blacks even in the face of prevalent &#34;colorblind&#34; attitudes of most Americans today.  We don't directly label blacks as inferior and make them ride the back of the bus today, we just try real hard to get them labeled as felons, then we can discriminate.  And most Americans don't realize we're doing it and how much damage this causes.  It's also expensive and a waste of taxpayer dollars.In the final chapters Alexander offers some ideas on how to dismantle this system.  It's very hard, and it's not enough to file lawsuits in individual cases.  It requires a major protest movement.  Many things have to be undone, such as the entire drug war, disenfranchisement laws, the management of prisons by private corporations to name a few. But the resistance will be huge because many jobs would disappear, and no one wants to be seen making life better for criminals.  Also, colorblindness won't do - we need to be conscious of racial differences yet driven to treat everyone with respect, fairness and kindness.  It's a totally different mindset for most Americans.  Especially fascinating was her description of how such concessions, or &#34;racial bribes&#34;, as affirmative action serve to justify continuing the system as it is.  Affirmative action has helped a lot of blacks become successful, but it glosses over the main problem.  The fact that we have a black President also obscures the real issues.Alexander states also that a full treatment of how to fix this problem would require another book, and I eagerly await that.

This book really helped me, a white reader, better understand the origins of black anger and frustration, gangsta culture, and the hollow gains of black exceptionalism.If you're an American not interested in race, you should be. Alexander makes the good point that America's situation is unique: we are an immigrant nation (including millions of descendants of forced immigrants) in a world otherwise divided along ethnic lines. We have huge problems that no other nation has ever needed or wanted to solve, yet we've been unwilling throughout our history to get to the core of the issues. To some—myself included, before reading this book—race relations in American history may seem curiously backward.

I'm not prone to melodrama, or to such excessively long reviews, but this is true, and so important to me, I have to say it.  I've been working for years in an extremely busy law office.  It's been growing harder and harder throughout the years for me to handle this job.  Two months ago my boss fired my coworker, and I've since had to take on two people's work plus train multiple new people (as the first two didn't stay), all with constant, all day long interruptions, high-intensity demands, and a high level of multitasking.  This has happened many times before, and while it was dreadful, I managed, but for some reason this time I just couldn't handle it.  My entire life has been on hold since this started, I get home from work too exhausted to do anything except veg out for a couple hours and go to bed, and even weekends aren't much better.  I was taking terrible care of myself and my life was falling apart.  I did, in fact, feel like I was killing myself with this lifestyle, but I simply did not have the energy to fix any of it, or for that matter have any idea how to fix it.I blamed myself - there must be something `wrong with me' because I can't handle the job.  I wanted to leave, but thought, if I can't handle this job, how am I going to handle a new job?  It'll probably be more of the same.  I thought I was just getting soft because I was getting older (I'm in my late 40s).I've always known I was introverted, but I didn't realize just what all that entailed - I thought it mostly meant `shy' or that I didn't like social settings.This book taught me more about myself than I've ever known.  It read like my biography.  Almost every page had a new insight into why I think and feel the way I do.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user7.id, book_id: book24.id })

As somebody who has been called at some point or another the gamut of terms associated with introversion, from shy (which I don't object) to anti-social (which I most certainly consider unfair), I found in Susan Cain's Quiet, the validation and appreciation many introverts have been searching for.In Quiet, Ms. Cain explains the rise of the Extrovert Ideal in the 1920s and how it is that today we associate talkative, risk-taking, and action-oriented people with intelligence, beauty, power and success.  The Extrovert Ideal is so pervasive that influences our work performance, educational policies, political choices, and even the country's financial health.  But the focus of Quiet is on exposing the myths and misunderstandings that were born when we as a culture embraced the Extrovert Ideal and turned introversion into a malady to be avoided.To dispel the misconception that introversion is some kind of sickness or weirdness, Ms. Cain traces both the biological and cultural basis for introversion and extroversion and their role as evolutionary survival strategies in animals and humans.  She interviews scientists who have conducted hundreds of studies to test different theories in an effort to determine how much of our temperament is a result of genetics and/or of our free will.The best part of Quiet is that the insights gleaned from these studies can help introverts take advantage of their special traits and thrive on their own terms in an extroverted world.  Since introversion and extroversion are preferences for a certain level of outside stimulation, Ms. Cain advises introverts to find their sweet spot --or what scientists call the optimal level of arousal.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user10.id, book_id: book24.id })

It&#x2019;s been both a source of delight and comfort for her, but also the cause of an ongoing struggle with her weight. In Food, Health, and Happiness, Oprah shares the recipes that have allowed eating to finally be joyful for her. With dishes created and prepared alongside her favorite chefs, paired with personal essays and memories from Oprah herself, this cookbook offers a candid, behind-the-scenes look into the life (and kitchen!) of one of the most influential and respected celebrities in the world. Delicious, healthy, and easy to prepare, these are the recipes Oprah most loves to make at home and share with friends and family.

Review.create({ title: "Unfried Chicken... Who Knew?", rating: 5, body: "When it comes to books, Oprah Winfrey and a book recommendation tend to go hand in hand. So, when it was decided that Oprah would release a cookbook, even though I am a fan, even I was skeptical. I asked my sister, “Isn’t she using Weight Watchers? How does that fit in?” Second, she really doesn’t need the money!Like Oprah, my sister and I struggled with our weight. We tried everything. I mean absolutely everything. Thanks to a little book called The Hungry Chick Dieting Solution, which has become the best kept secret to weight loss, I really lost 11 pounds, and that sluggish feeling from the extra weight, since my kids went back to school in the fall. I have been working hard not to do anything to mess that up.So, my sister convinced me to get this book. If my sister recommends a book, I tend to go get it. She recommended The Hungry Chick Dieting Solution to me years ago, and it took for me seeing a bunch of other mentions about it to finally go get it. I apologize, let’s get back to Oprah.Let me start out by saying, even before you get to some of the most amazing recipes ever, this book is made with love. It is so beautifully done that I don’t want to muck it up with flour or splashes of oil from my kitchen. It’s also very candid. Flipping through, I love the story about Lassie and even as a fan, I learned a better way to make tomato soup. Soup is love. That is my favorite chapter.For all the people that struggled, like I did with WW points, many moons ago. The point system is there. But, this isn’t a WW book. Instead, it will introduce you to amazing dishes, that will either get you back into the kitchen or inspire you to make your own. From the Unfried Chicken, who knew, to the Turkey Lasagna. The sorbet, I have had before, but it was interesting enough, if you haven’t. This really is a great book. Great food, no regrets. I just wish it had been available before Christmas. It would have made an awesome gift. Other than that, I highly recommend it.If you are serious about eating healthier and following Oprah’s push to eat more clean, with less processed foods, I also highly recommend that you also buy, or even borrow from your local library, The Hungry Chick Dieting Solution. It changes how you will eat anything and everything for the better. I pray that it helps you as much as it has helped me and my family.", user_id: user2.id, book_id: book25.id })

The guests range from super celebs (Jamie Foxx, Arnold Schwarzenegger, etc.) and athletes (icons of powerlifting, gymnastics, surfing, etc.) to legendary Special Operations commanders and black-market biochemists. For most of my guests, it&rsquo;s the first time they&rsquo;ve agreed to a two-to-three-hour interview.

It also includes new tips from past guests, and life lessons from new &lsquo;guests&rsquo; you haven&rsquo;t met. &#160; &ldquo;What makes the show different is a relentless focus on actionable details. This is reflected in the questions. For example: What do these people do in the first sixty minutes of each morning? What do their workout routines look like, and why? What books have they gifted most to other people? What are the biggest wastes of time for novices in their field? What supplements do they take on a daily basis? &#160; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t view myself as an interviewer. I view myself as an experimenter.

No sarcasm, no snark.DISCLAIMER: I am a Tim Ferriss apologist. I've listened to almost every episode of his podcast. Own his books. Have been following him since 4 Hour Work Week came out.Tim's podcast has rewired my brain. My life is measurably better because of what I've learned. Literally. I have hereditary cholesterol problems and my forays into a ketogenic lifestyle dropped my particle count from ~1950 to ~1225. There are many other great things that have come as a result of my exposure to Tim's podcast, too many to list here.When he announced TOOLS OF TITANS, I was ecstatic. I pre-ordered this book in September.I'm sad to say that I'm non-plussed, borderline disappointed.On one hand, I love having a &#34;totem&#34; of something that has changed my life so profoundly. To that end, I am happy to own the book.On the other hand, it does not deliver on its promise. This is supposedly a &#34;recipe book&#34; (according to page xvi in the Foreword).It is no such thing.If I want to bake an apple pie, I go to the Table of Contents, I look up apple pie, I turn to that page.You cannot do that in this book.Tim has amazing things to say about meditation. A few guests on his podcast have amazing things to say about meditation (Sam Harris, Naval Ravikant, Kevin Rose, etc.).But there is no central place to which you can turn to find out the collected wisdom of the many guests who have delved into this topic.The same goes for investing. The same goes for particular health hacks.In fact, there's not even one central place in the book that gives a list of the commonalities between the guests. That's a HUGE missed opportunity.THE ADVICE:Make a second edition. Soon. It doesn't even have to add new content. Just tighten this up and make it so that you can read about certain topics in a centralized place. If there are parts that don't fit, maybe have an author section at the back... but, dang.FINAL THOUGHT:Millionaires become millionaires (in part) because they've learned to say &#34;no.&#34; They have the discipline to turn down the good, so that they can pursue (and achieve) the great.This book is just too too too much good. It doesn't tell you what is great. It will leave you chasing dozens upon dozens of random tactics and thoughts in a dozen different fields.It might teach the tactics and routines and habits of world-class performers, but there's FAR TOO MUCH here to make it valuable in showing YOU how to achieve those heights. And, if there is ONE person that you could model to become like them in their field... there is FAR TOO LITTLE here to actually help you on your way.", user_id: user2.id, book_id: book27.id })

Review.create({ title: "Good not great, and I want great from Tim.", rating: 3, body: "Tim's previous books are incredible and you should buy them all. Those books show incredible mission, clarity, and voice.This book suffers from the expectations of his previous work--Tim is honest about presenting &#34;Tools of Titans&#34; as sort of a glimpse of his journals/notes from his life's work, but this book loses nearly everything we've come to expect.First, due to the content (it's a compendium of quips/quotes/summations from past work and in particular, his podcasts) there's no sense of mission and the book feels scattered. Yes, you can sort of pick this up book and it reads like a reference digest, but Tim's voice fades and it feels without purpose. It's WebMD with a clouded personality...it's a bit like a bound website without the hyperlinking.Next, keeping Tim's literary voice at the fringe makes the book far less interesting. His personality is buried, his sense of adventure and joyous curiosity isn't apparent, so we care less about the character and the journey. His books have always succeeded on those terms--he's made us excited about his life and why he does what he does, but here his character is almost non-existent.Finally, although I don't think it's the case, the book doesn't seem challenging for Tim. I don't think he phoned it in, and I know trying to make sense of a lifetime's worth of notes (tools!) was incredibly challenging, but there's a part of me as a reader that expected much more channeled insight. He's shown he's capable of completely rethinking a problem or a lifestyle or a way of doing things, and this book isn't like that at all.If you've read all of Tim's stuff and listened to a fair amount of his podcasts, this book is going to seem like familiar territory. Nice to have some of the best nuggets all in one spot, but I don't buy his books out of convenience.

Review.create({ title: "Good writing but limited perspective", rating: 3, body: "Jen Sincero is a talented writer, and her edgy, irreverent style will be inspiring and motivational to many readers. If you've read other self help books then you probably won't find much that's new here. In fact, it's really the in-your-face tone and humor in her writing that makes this book worthwhile. As for her ideas, I personally found a lot to take issue with. First, she has a very polarized view of spiritual growth that divides our lives in to those that suck and those that are awesome. Maybe that works for young millennials just starting out in life, and if that's the audience she&#8217;s g oing for, then great, but most of us are somewhere on a continuum and her assertions that life is either this way or that way are simplistic to say the least. Sincero also uses a lot of highly critical, edgy language to describe people who are struggling or stuck - therefore not as awesome as she is - using words like &#34;lame-o &#34; &#34;suck&#34; &#34;wuss&#34;  ...well, you get the idea. This may be mildly amusing the first time around, but it gets old fast and it's not exactly kind to those who may really be struggling. I have to confess that I question a writer who continually references her own life choices and personal career success as a model that the rest of us should follow. There is an exhibitionistic, narcissistic, &#34;look at me&#34;, &#34;look at how successful I am&#34; dimension running through this book that is self-indulgent while lacking insight about what success could mean or look like for another person.  Read this book for a quick shot of motivation if that's what you need, it's good for that, but look elsewhere for help in developing your own ideas and values about  success and purpose.

I was literally prepared to go out and buy three more volumes for my friends.Until Chapter 17.About halfway through the book, Sincero begins talking about excuses. Okay, yes. A valuable thing to discuss. People, myself included, make excuses all the time. But she decides to target a set group of people.People who are clinically depressed. She says, and I'm paraphrasing here, that depression is a comfort because it gives those who suffer from it an excuse not to do anything but stay in bed....And that is precisely when I tuned out. I went from loving everything she said to eye rolling in a matter of seconds.My clinical depression is not an excuse. It isn't me being lazy. It isn't me snickering as I back out on plans I make with friends. It's me literally being unable to do anything because my disease is keeping me from doing it. There are days where I can't do anything at all. There are days where laundry piles up and my bedroom becomes a disaster and I hide away from the world because I don't think I'm worthy of being seen. There are days where I stop seeing my friends because I feel like I'm a burden to them.And my friends understand this. They know what I go through and they know that if I need some time to myself to get my brain under control, then it isn't an excuse. It doesn't mean I don't love them. It means that I'm just dealing with negative thoughts and I need to work through it. The fact that Sincero completely misunderstands depression ruined this book for me instantly. Yes, I will admit she gives valuable advice. But once I figured out that her advice disvalues someone like me, I checked out.Also, her advice...is highly privileged.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user11.id, book_id: book28.id })

Review.create({ title: "Do you really want a self help book by someone who thinks calling you a wimp will be motivating?", rating: 1, body: "I rarely write negative reviews because I know that what goes into writing a book is a lot of hard work. But as a therapist, I am concerned that the &#34;badass&#34; attitude that the author holds toward the reader is potentially damaging. Several times in the first 1/2 of the book (which was all I could stomach) she declares that you are a wimp if you don't follow her ideas or methods. Ick. This totally goes against the basic premise of the law of attraction. There are so many books on manifesting that are more comprehensive and respectful to the reader. And the information is not rocket surgery. Here are the basics:1. Self limiting beliefs that you formed from early negative experiences hold you back from doing what you would most love.2. Those same beliefs are likely creating self-criticism, anxiety and depression in you, which also holds you back.3. Learning to love yourself (by practicing doing loving things and speaking to yourself kindly and compassionately) will eventually shift your beliefs. You can speed up this process with repetition (mantras, affirmations, etc.).4. If all the spiritual, woo-woo talk about frequencies and vibrations makes you roll your eyes, no worries. It is your own energy that creates the relationships, experiences and perceptions you have. You know this from experience. When you are having a great day, the world looks brighter. People seem friendlier (because they are responding to your warmth). When your day is sucking, everyone becomes a pain in the butt.5. Staying in a loving space with yourself requires ongoing maintenance and support. You will do better if you limit contact with people who make you feel bad or doubt yourself and increase contact with those you make you feel stronger and happier.6.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user13.id, book_id: book28.id })

Review.create({ title: "It's like Christmas in my Kitchen.", rating: 5, body: "Hi, my name is Meg and I'm a chronic failure when it comes to dieting. (hi, meg!)The absolute BEST thing about Whole30 is that it simply is not a diet. I first stumbled upon Whole30 after two different friends--from two different friend circles--discussed this 30 day &#34;plan&#34; they were completing. As one girl whined and moaned about not being able to chew gum, I naturally took that as a challenge and thought: I'll do this Whole30 and not be such a baby about it. I read the Whole30 blog, I used Instagram as a means to gather additional recipes and helpful hints, and ten days later, I began day one. Surprisingly, I found it to be the BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED to my little round self. I gained confidence, learned that I do have the ability to say &#34;no&#34; to food cravings, discovered a myriad of new recipes, cured all of my PCOS symptoms (regular menstrual cycles for the first time in ten years and no cysts), and as a bonus, dropped 2 pants sizes. As a child, I was in and out of the hospital with stomach pains and problems (I'll spare all the details) and after following Melissa & Dallas' Whole30, I ate sans stomach aches for the first time EVER. Truly, I did not know that was possible. For my entire life eating a meal meant some level of pain/discomfort while my food digested. Not anymore! Also, chronic migraines: gone!Whole30 can be a challenge, but it isn't hard. It's worth it.About this book: LAWD, HAVE MERCY! It's beautiful. I'm leaving it on my coffee table forever. (Confession: I did, in fact, walk back and forth from my kitchen to my coffee table while I cooked tonight because I didn't want to risk getting food on the new pages. It's brand new and I'm in love, okay?) It presents all information necessary to complete Whole30, informs one about all rules, discusses the importance of following the rules, and provides a plethora of recipes and resources. (They went above and beyond here, people.) The photography is amazing. The typography is stunning. The recipes are delicious. And, may I say again that the book is just so incredibly BEAUTIFUL?From one wonder woman to another wonder (wo)man, you must buy the book. Give Whole30 a try.  (If all else fails, you'll have a stunning book on display to let all your guests see how &#34;healthy&#34; you are.)But really, Whole30.

Review.create({ title: "Wonderful recipes and a great program", rating: 5, body: "This book is exactly what I have been looking for. Instead of trying to keep track of all the continual debates on diet, the authors have created a plan for you to find out what works best for you (as well as what makes you feel like junk.) The 30 days were difficult, don't get me wrong, but it was so empowering to resist my cravings! I sleep better, have a better mood, lost weight and fat so now I look lean and muscular! (Confession: I used to work out everyday but once I started the program I didn't have enough time to exercise so no, I didn't reach these results from hitting the gym; it's all about food.)It is a lot of work and a lot of time spent in the kitchen so I recommend that you wait until the time is right for you. You should give the program 100% effort and if you are too stressed, busy, or just don't have the time to make all of this homemade food you will probably get discouraged and fall off track. But if you think you can fit it into your life, get a support group together and start right away, it will change your life!Last thing: the recipes are phenomenal! I have been in a cooking rut for the past year and these recipes have cured me. I was so shocked that meal after meal was a delight to eat. So even if you don't do the program this is a worth-while purchase for the recipes alone. Just make sure you actually follow the entire recipe... Imitations, substitutes, and cutting corners will result in food with a lot less flavor. There's also lots of cooking hints hidden throughout all of the recipes that will change the way you cook, and therefore how your food tastes!", user_id: user2.id, book_id: book29.id })

I know that you aren't supposed to weigh yourself on this program, but weighing myself is a motivator so I decided to skip that rule. It's only been two weeks and already I feel so much better. I am more alert in the mornings and my acid reflex is gone. In addition, my migraines seemed to have disappeared entirely. What is really motivating me is the fact that I lost 15 pounds and 10 overall inches in two weeks. I also love the fact that I have the energy to exercise again. I look forward to continuing this program even after my 30 days are up. I just feel that healthy and energetic! I'll post an update once my 30 days are complete. :)Update: So today is day 18 on my Whole30 journey. I just wanted to let you guys know that there is a lot of cooking involved with this program. I'm actually tired of cooking, which is why I started making large meals to freeze for the week. It actually works out well for me, especially since I don't mind eating the same food everyday. I've also been drinking a lot of tea and water. I feel like it is helping to flush out more toxins from my body. I has been approximately four days since my previous review and I lost an additional 2 pounds on this journey. I have so much energy that I actually am unable to sit still like I used to. I guess I was depressed before going on this journey so the Whole30 has actually improved my mood as well. I go for a walk every day and I've actually started a new workout program!Update: So I just finished Day 23 of my Whole30 Journey and I feel good, aside from the fact that I caught a cold. Weighing myself today, I discovered that I lost 19.5 pounds so far! I measured myself and immediately noted that I lost 19 inches over all (I measure my chest, both arms, both legs, waist, and hips). I think when I am done with my first round, I'll take a day off then start a second round. I just feel that great overall.Update: So I just finished my first whole30 round and I have to say that I'm super excited by the results. When I hopped on the scale today, I noticed that I had lost 26.6 pounds. I then measured myself and noted that I lost a total of 31.5 inches (-5&#34; from chest, -2&#34; from right arm, -3.5&#34; from left arm, -8&#34; from waist, -5&#34; from hips, -4&#34; from right thigh, and -4&#34; from left thigh). I am really excited by my results!I plan to have a celebratory dinner tonight (likely a gluten free pizza from papa Murphy's), then I will start my second round of whole30 tomorrow. I think that I might actually reach my goal of losing 50 pounds by August!I'll keep you guys posted! If you have any questions, feel free to comment. I will do my best to answer them. :)", user_id: user3.id, book_id: book29.id })

That said, I'm normally a huge Whole 30 fan and use the recipes from the Whole30: 30 Day Guide... all the time. Something that I appreciated from the 30 Day Guide was the simplicity of the recipes, most were kid friendly and included lots of one pot meals that work for busy people. That is not the case with the new recipe book.Some points I wish were different:1) Many of the recipes are complicated, like REALLY complicated. Some requiring as many as 20 ingredients to complete. Others require uncommon ingredients, which will likely not be reused, especially if there isn't another recipe in the book asking for it. Something I appreciated in the 30 Day Guide was that ingredients were frequently used in more than one recipe so they were worth the investment.2) There is a big step up in the use of tree nuts in the cookbook. I never really got why tree nuts would be included in an anti-inflammatory diet when they are one of the more common allergens. Aside from that, I'm super allergic to tree nuts (need an epi-pen) so this was, personally, lame for me. Nuts were easy to avoid in 30 Day Guide but many more recipes include them in the cookbook.3) A lot of the recipes are what some would consider &#34;exotic&#34; and may need to be sold to kids. Sure, not everyone buying the book has kids but a lot of us do so let's keep it simple. I appreciate some exotic dishes (especially Indian and African foods) here and there and I encourage my kids to try variety but... really... I need more simple recipes that won't meet opposition. Simple, uncomplicated foods without a tons of strong spices. Complicated dishes are appreciated in moderation in cookbooks, not nearly every recipe.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user13.id, book_id: book30.id })

After losing the one thing that would have allowed her to protect the Timeline, and the one person worth fighting for, Etta awakens alone in an unknown place and time, exposed to the threat of the two groups who would rather see her dead than succeed. When help arrives, it comes from the last person Etta ever expected—Julian Ironwood, the Grand Master’s heir who has long been presumed dead, and whose dangerous alliance with a man from Etta’s past could put them both at risk.Meanwhile, Nicholas and Sophia are racing through time in order to locate Etta and the missing astrolabe with Ironwood travelers hot on their trail. They cross paths with a mercenary-for-hire, a cheeky girl named Li Min who quickly develops a flirtation with Sophia. But as the three of them attempt to evade their pursuers, Nicholas soon realizes that one of his companions may have ulterior motives.As Etta and Nicholas fight to make their way back to one another, from Imperial Russia to the Vatican catacombs, time is rapidly shifting and changing into something unrecognizable… and might just run out on both of them.What I Liked:SPOILER-FREE REVIEW. (Unless you haven't read Passenger.)One-line summary: This book is every bit as fascinating, captivating, and thrilling as its predecessor, and a page-turning, satisfying conclusion to the series.I was extremely excited when I received this book early for review, but also wary. It's a long book (500+ pages), and the story is at an intense point (from the end of Passenger). I was nervous to read Wayfarer, because there are so many ways that this book could end, and most of them are bittersweet (or just plain cruel). I'm so happy to say that Wayfarer was incredibly engrossing and it ended rather perfectly - Bracken found a way.This book picks up a little after the end of Passenger. Nicholas and Etta have been separated in time and space. Etta wakes up as a captive of the Thorns, and she meets someone she never thought she'd know. She, Julian Ironwood, and the Thorns set out to secure the astrolabe from Cyrus Ironwood. Meanwhile, Nicholas and Sophia seek help from Rose Linden, only to be turned around several times. Looking for information, the pair accumulate a number of favors they must return. They meet Li Min, a mysterious and secretive traveler who helps them more than once. But Nicholas has one goal, and that is to find Etta. Sophia wants to find the astrolabe. And Li Min knows more than she is letting on.I'm still reeling a little, so bear with me as I go about this review. I've just finished the book and I'm in a pleasant state of shock, partial numbness, and total satisfaction. This book... I don't remember my exact expectations, before starting it. Hoping that Nicholas and Etta would survive and be together? In any case, I'm so pleased by what was written, and its delivery.One thing I do recommend is a reread of Passenger, or checking out some sort of spoiler-filled review or post. Bracken has a spoiler-y graphic available on her website. I wish I had reread Passenger, because besides the ending, I didn't remember a ton of specifics. The good thing was, as I continued to read Wayfarer, I realized that I didn't need to remember too many specifics, because more and more came back to me. At first though, not the case.One of the best parts of this book was the character development and introduction/development of new and smaller characters that had no or little role in Passenger. For example, I thought Sophia played a bigger role in this book - an enormous role. She is the most important &#34;secondary&#34; character (arguably a primary character? She doesn't have a narrative in the books though). I understood and liked Sophia so much more, in this book. She seems ruthless and blunt and sometimes harsh, but she is so determined and driven. She is someone you want on your side, because she is a dirty fighter.Julian Ironwood, Nicholas's half-brother, is another secondary character who quickly becomes very important in Wayfarer. He betrayed his grandfather and sought refuge with the Thorns, which is how he and Etta meet. When she wakes up, she tries to escape, and she runs into Julian. Julian is a coward and a runner, but we get to understand him better in this book. He is an idiot and a poor brother, but he learns this and matures a lot, over the course of this book.I enjoyed the presence of Li Min and Henry Hemlock. I won't say much on either of them, but both are vastly important in this book, and play critical roles in pivotal points in the story. I didn't love or hate Li Min, but I adored Henry Hemlock. His interactions with Etta were wonderful.Etta shows her fight and her tenacity in this book! She keeps moving, with grief, guilt, even pain weighing her down. She knows that Nicholas is out there, and she knows that the astrolabe must be found and taken out of the Ironwoods' grasp. Her goals are lofty but she never quits.The same can be said about Nicholas. He wants to find Etta and never stops hunting for information and leads. He and Sophia travel to so many different places and times, and make various (terrible) deals for information, to find Etta. Finding the astrolabe is important but to Nicholas, finding Etta is everything. Nicholas has such a pure and good heart, such upstanding morals. He's a good guy who considers everything, weighs everything, and questions everything. I liked seeing how his mind worked, and I liked seeing him push through pain and doubt.Etta and Nicholas are separated from much of the book, so I can't really say much about physical romance, but their relationship is strong through space and time. It's amazing how they never cease thinking about each other, hoping that the other is alright, and fighting for each other. They do interact at points toward the end of the book, I will say that.I died emotionally no fewer than seventeen times while reading this book. There were times when I actually teared up (my Goodreads statuses are proof). There were some painful parts in this book! Bracken took me on an emotional roller coaster. But for the better!I love the varying settings that Bracken takes us through! Between Etta and Nicholas, we are introduced to so many different times and places. The most interesting, in this book, was probably Carthage, 148 B.C. How intriguing!By the climax of the book, you'll be wondering how on earth Bracken can end this book with something happy or positive. There seems to be no way, with certain revelations about the astrolabe, and a darker force that is at play, and certain deals with devils that are very unfair. But Bracken made the ending worth all of the anguish and agony! I promise.What I Did Not Like:I don't really have much to say here, other than I do wish there had been more Nicholas/Etta interaction! I don't want to spoil anything, but the romantic in me would have loved more interactions. Of any kind.Not really a dislike, but I do recommend a Passenger reread, if that one isn't fresh. For example, I read Passenger over a year ago. A reread might have helped, at least initially. After a certain point in Wayfarer though, some things started to come back.Would I Recommend It:I highly recommend this book, and series! Time-traveling novels can be tricky, and very messy. I haven't read a ton of them, but one of my favorite series of all time happens to be a time-travel series - the Ruby Red trilogy by Kerstin Gier. I can safely add this Passenger duology to those ranks. This is a wonderful, fascinating, and imaginative series! With a very satisfying ending.Rating:4.5 stars. I'm still trying to decide if to round up or down. But rest assured, I loved this book, all 532 pages of it. It is worth the full spectrum of emotions that I experienced! I look forward to reading more from Bracken in the future.", date: "January 3, 2017Rating: 4 starsSource: Review copy sent by the publisherSummary (from Goodreads):All Etta Spencer wanted was to make her violin debut when she was thrust into a treacherous world where the struggle for power could alter history. After losing the one thing that would have allowed her to protect the Timeline, and the one person worth fighting for, Etta awakens alone in an unknown place and time, exposed to the threat of the two groups who would rather see her dead than succeed. When help arrives, it comes from the last person Etta ever expected—Julian Ironwood, the Grand Master’s heir who has long been presumed dead, and whose dangerous alliance with a man from Etta’s past could put them both at risk.Meanwhile, Nicholas and Sophia are racing through time in order to locate Etta and the missing astrolabe with Ironwood travelers hot on their trail. They cross paths with a mercenary-for-hire, a cheeky girl named Li Min who quickly develops a flirtation with Sophia. But as the three of them attempt to evade their pursuers, Nicholas soon realizes that one of his companions may have ulterior motives.As Etta and Nicholas fight to make their way back to one another, from Imperial Russia to the Vatican catacombs, time is rapidly shifting and changing into something unrecognizable… and might just run out on both of them.What I Liked:SPOILER-FREE REVIEW. (Unless you haven't read Passenger.)One-line summary: This book is every bit as fascinating, captivating, and thrilling as its predecessor, and a page-turning, satisfying conclusion to the series.I was extremely excited when I received this book early for review, but also wary.

Review.create({ title: "An unforgettable, epic and amazing must-read sequel", rating: 5, body: "There aren’t enough words to describe just how amazing and incredible and epic a sequel WAYFARER is. It is action-packed. It is suspenseful It takes you to fascinating places and times. It will keep you guessing. It will keep you hoping. It will break your heart again and again. It will take you on an adventure and on an emotional roller coaster. And then it will blow your mind.Without the ability to travel through time, Etta Spencer and Nicholas Carter never would have met, gotten to know one another, fallen in love. Being a traveler wasn’t inherently a bad thing. But there were risks. And there were often serious consequences. And over the centuries those with the ability to travel, intentionally or not, caused so much damage and destruction that reverting back to the original timeline seemed like the best solution to a growing problem.But the only way to do that would be to find the device that could make that happen. Again. This time without any clues as to who has it, where it is, or when it is. This time facing even more danger, confronting deadlier foes, working with an even more challenging timeframe. This time searching without each other.Twists and turns, secrets and betrayal, heartbreak and loss fill this story. Love and hope, strength and honor, bravery and sacrifice infuse its every page. The journeys are harrowing, nail-biting, tension-filled, heart-stopping. The love story is sweet, bittersweet, and so very romantic. The ending is unforgettable.What Alexandra Bracken did in this follow-up to an extraordinary first book in the series is outstanding. She delivers more beautifully-written passages, paints more stunning pictures with her words, invents more intriguing time-travel locations, introduces more interesting characters, reveals more about the travelers, the families, the past, offers more food for thought, creates more heart-wrenching moments.WAYFARER will fill you with wonder, bring tears to your eyes, and leave you desperately wishing your travels through time with these characters never had to end.Expect to be surprised. Expect to be transported. Expected to be riveted from start to finish. And expect to fall madly in love with this rich, gorgeous, and absolutely remarkable read.", user_id: user1.id, book_id: book31.id })

There are rules to the &#8220;battle&#8221;, and the triplets must wait until they are sixteen to start trying to kill their sisters, with the winner becoming queen.Raised apart from each other, and schooled in their specialties, the triplets don&#8217;t have a particular love for each other, as they were separated at an early age and are trained to kill in order to be queen.Out of the three sisters, Arsinoe probably was the most likeable; she seems carefree and down-to-earth and genuinely cares for her friends. Katherine was a bit too obsessed with learning how to seduce for me to really care for her (why must this be a lesson she needs to learn??). Although, I did love the fact that her favorite piece of &#8220;jewelry&#8221; was her very poisonous pet coral snake worn as a bracelet. And Mirabella, well, Mirabella was fine, she was probably the kindest of the sisters, and seems to be the one sister willing to try to not fight and instead be friends, but then she goes and has sex with a random guy (who of course isn&#8217;t random) on the beach after he washes ashore. It was just way too much of insta-love for me, and was flat-out irritating, and brought a weird love triangle into the mix that I just didn&#8217;t care about.With mention of the three different gifts (poison, naturalist, and elemental), there is also mention of &#8220;rare&#8221; gifts: the war gift and the sight gift.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user2.id, book_id: book32.id })

Review.create({ title: "Maybe I'm just not quite the right audience for this book", rating: 2, body: "I bought this book because of how much I enjoyed Blake's Anna Dressed in Blood and Girl of Nightmares.  I was curious what sort of high fantasy story she might tell.  I'm conflicted about writing this review because on the one hand I did not like this book.  But on the other hand, I think there are a lot of people who will love it.  So maybe my opinion on this one doesn't really matter.The book is the story of 3 sisters, triplets who were separated as children and raised by different magical/political factions.  Eventually the sisters will continue the land's mythic tradition of attempting to kill each other using their mystic powers (one can resist poison, one can control the elements, and one can bond with and control animals) and the survivor will be crowned queen.  The story moves from sister to sister with each chapter, describing the months leading up to the ceremony which marks the beginning of open war between them.I think the world Blake is striving to create is a dark fairy tale place, a world with strange rules aren't rational but are consistent within the confines of the story.  I think many readers will enjoy that element, swept up in the wild fantasy of it, but I was bothered by the fact that her world seems poorly thought out.  Though it gives the impression of a fairy tale place, it lacks the clarity and simplicity of fairy tales.  Blake tries to create a more complex and nuanced world, but she never steps back to give the reader a clear view of it, so we're left with something that feels cluttered and poorly thought out.  Concepts and rules pop up randomly when Blake needs a new plot device to knock the characters around with.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user10.id, book_id: book32.id })

I'm a mom of 4 young daughters, and they look up to Simone Biles so much.  She is such an inspiration - so I was glad to see this book about her life.  It's extremely well written - the ghostwriter did an amazing job of capturing Simone's tough early life, her sweet and confident spirit, as well as her unflagging work ethic.  I liked how open Simone was about her early life (with Shannon) and how that shaped both her and her siblings' experiences growing up.  This is not a book for kids to read (unless they are older) - but I liked reading about this amazing athlete who inspires my girls in such a big way.  It's always wonderful to read the story behind the success - and I feel like this book gives you a really good idea of what Simone's life was like before the Olympics in an honest way - and even that Olympians at the top of their game can be subjected to harsh, unfounded criticism.  But even when bad things happened to Simone (like a coach calling her overweight in the middle of a competition) - she was able to rise above it and use it in a positive way to push her to the next level.  Although very few of us will ever achieve what Simone has - she shows that if you take your natural abilities and pair them with incredible dedication and sacrifice, big things are possible!

Review.create({ title: "Warmed My Tiny Heart", rating: 5, body: "&#34;It's like knowing all the words to a song but still finding them beautiful and surprising.&#34;And that's this book more or less in a nutshell. I knew exactly what was going to happen in this book. You know, too. These two crazy kids were going to fall in love, and it would change their lives forever. But the journey they take to get there... it's still awe inspiring.How does Nicola Yoon even do this? Because when I read the blurb for this book I was not impressed. However, having enjoyed Everything, Everything I took a chance on it. Boy, am I glad I did. I think The Sun is Also a Star exceeds its predecessor. Yoon has an amazing talent for telling beautiful, heartwarming stories using lovely prose that is in no way fussy or overworked.We follow the tale of Daniel and Natasha, two strangers who fate seems determined to push together. Daniel is the son of Korean immigrants who want him to go to Yale and become a doctor-- and they aren't really asking. Daniel does not want to displease his parents, but he is a natural poet who finds meaning in words rather than science. Natasha is the exact opposite. She doesn't even believe in love, much less love from first sight. Natasha's father is a failed actor, and the resentment she feels towards him has made her abandon any thought of have passion or dreams. The day Natasha and Daniel meet is a pivotal point for both of them. Daniel has an interview for Yale. Natasha is about to be deported. One day with someone can't possibly be enough to fall in love with them... right?Even though I gave this book 5 stars, and it deserved it, I still can't help but nitpick a little. There are a lot of perspective shifts in this book, some in first person and others in third, and sometimes that interrupted the flow of the story for me. I also thought the very ending was a bit reminiscent of Yoon's first book.If you're a fan of charming romances, pick this one up. You won't regret it.", user_id: user1.id, book_id: book34.id })

The writing is well-done, and she pays tribute to Lewis Carroll's Wonderland without stifling her own creativity. The characters are fresh and unique while at the same time drawing our mind to the original story. I almost prefer her version of Wonderland to Carroll's, mostly because the original story is a bit too nonsensical for my personal preference&#8212;Meyer was able to order enough of the chaos to create a story with solid structure, while leaving plenty of fantasy for the reader to enjoy. She mentions in the acknowledgements that she was inspired by Gregory Maguire's works, many of which I've read, and I must say I think she's taken his idea and improved upon it greatly.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user5.id, book_id: book35.id })

HEARTLESS is one of those stories that will be remembered and loved long after the final page has been turned. It is delightful and magical and fun and sweet and silly. And it is oh so very clever. And captivating. And devastating. And surprising.One would not expect the Queen of Hearts to be a sympathetic character, let alone a likable one. Yet Marissa Meyer made her into someone very likable. She gave her character hopes and dreams, even if they might have been unrealistic. She put her character into challenging and often no-win situations, forced her to make difficult decisions, and limited her possibilities. And she made her character's transformation from who she was to who she became very believable.Catherine was hopeful and foolish and emotional and passionate about the things she loved. She wasn't particularly strong or defiant or independent. And she definitely wasn't the hot-tempered and blood-thirsty Queen she would become. She wanted the impossible - a simple life, love, happiness.

Review.create({ title: "Another emotional novel of healing that old and new fans are going to love (4.5 stars)", rating: 4, body: "The final installment in Debbie Macomber’s heartwarming Rose Harbor series, Sweet Tomorrows is another emotional novel of healing that old and new fans are going to love.Although it has been difficult, Jo Marie Rose has finally begun to move on in the months since she last saw Mark Taylor. Despite his declaration of love, he did not want her to wait around for his return from Iraq where he is attempting to save a good friend he was forced to leave behind several years ago. Having loved and lost her military husband years earlier, Jo Marie cannot bear to live with the uncertainty of whether or not Mark will safely return so, as he requested, she is moving on with her life. Finally ready to begin dating again, Jo Marie’s first foray into dating is rather lackluster but her dates with Greg Endsley are reminiscent of her relationship with her first husband. After receiving stunning news, her budding romance hangs in the balance as Jo Marie tries to decide whether or not to follow her heart in the midst of an uncertain future.A concurrent storyline revolves around Jo Marie’s newest guest, Emily Gaffney, who is starting over in Cedar Cove following the end of her engagement. Staying with Jo Marie long-term while house hunting, Emily finds her dream home only to have her hopes dashed when owner Nick Schwartz rudely tells her to stay off his property. Swearing off love after two broken engagements,  Emily is drawn to Nick who is dealing with emotional wounds of his own as he renovates the house he inherited from his grandmother.  While sympathetic to Nick’s struggles with PTSD and panic attacks, she tries to extricate herself from their on again/off again friendship but Emily finds it difficult to stay away from him as she resists falling in love again.Written though multiple points of view, the chapters alternate back and forth from the key players perspectives and this provides readers with insight as they struggle to come to terms with their various issues. Although Jo Marie is trying to move on, she cannot help but worry about Mark and her fears about his safety are renewed after she receives an enigmatic message from him.  Emily’s secret is heartbreaking and while she is certain she has found the perfect solution to avoid further pain, is her plan to avoid falling in love again realistic? Nick is unable to move on from a terrible tragedy and he remains mired in guilt and shame as he refuses to seek outside assistance in dealing with his PTSD and panic attacks.As with the previous novels in Rose Harbor series,Jo Marie’s B&B is a place where guests find peace and healing. Emily is skeptical of Jo Marie’s stories of visitors whose lives were irrevocably changed for the better during their stay.  Through Jo Marie’s conversations with Emily, longtime fans will be given the opportunity to catch up with the lives of characters from previous installments while newcomers to the series will be charmed by these heartfelt stories of love and reconciliation.Sweet Tomorrows is the perfect conclusion to the enchanting Rose Harbor series. Emily and Nick’s story arc is quite endearing and with a multitude of obstacles in their path, their road to happily ever after is somewhat bumpy. Debbie Macomber masterfully keeps readers guessing how Jo Marie’s storyline will conclude and the resolution is absolutely breathtaking.An outstanding conclusion to this beloved series that can be read as a standalone (but I HIGHLY recommend the entire series).I received a complimentary copy for review.", user_id: user1.id, book_id: book37.id })
Review.create({ title: "Sweet Tomorrows", rating: 4, body: "Sweet Tomorrows is the fifth and final book in Macomber’s Rose Harbor series. I’m usually a stickler and recommend that readers read a series in order. I stand by that advice but I’ll admit (and it’s hard to) that Sweet Tomorrows can be read without having read the previous books. Macomber does an excellent job of filling in the details so that the reader won’t feel lost. The series is a good one, so do go read the other books if you haven’t.Sweet Tomorrows opens where the previous book left off. Mark Taylor has abruptly left Cedar Cove. Even though he finally confessed his love for her before he left, Jo Marie Rose is unsure if he’s coming back. Will Mark make it back? Will the couple finally find a happily ever after? The pages of this book will answer these questions for you and finish Mark and Jo Marie’s journey. While there were parts of this journey that bothered me, in the end I’m happy with their story.Emily Gaffney is the newest guest at the Rose Harbor Inn. Like past guests of the inn, she’s looking for something. But after two failed relationships romance isn’t on her agenda. Readers of the series will enjoy a look back at some of the inns past guests as Jo Marie tells Emily the stories of healing that have taken place at the Rose Harbor Inn. Emily doesn’t believe that the inn holds the healing powers that Jo Marie does. But despite that Emily does find healing – in the form of Nick. I enjoyed Emily and Nick’s story but felt something was missing. It was a bit quick in my opinion. I wanted just a little more depth. An added bonus to Nick was Elvis, his German shepherd. I love when there are animals as characters in a books because they always add something special to books.Overall, I would recommend this conclusion to the series. The ending is satisfactory and each story is given a proper ending but I found myself wanting a little more. An epilogue perhaps that gave me that last glimpse into each of the character’s lives?Thank you Random House and NetGalley for providing a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.", user_id: user2.id, book_id: book37.id })

But its beautiful gothic exterior hides a horrific past: it was the scene of a series of depraved killings that have never been solved. Neglected, empty, and rumored to be cursed, it's known as the Murder House, and locals keep their distance. Detective Jenna Murphy used to consider herself a local, but she hasn't been back since she was a girl. Trying to escape her troubled past and rehabilitate a career on the rocks, the former New York City cop hardly expects her lush and wealthy surroundings to be a hotbed of grisly depravity. But when a Hollywood power broker and his mistress are found dead in the abandoned Murder House, the gruesome crime scene rivals anything Jenna experienced in Manhattan. And what at first seems like an open and shut case turns out to have as many shocking secrets as the Murder House itself, as Jenna quickly realizes that the mansion's history is much darker than even the town's most salacious gossips could have imagined. As more bodies surface, and the secret that Jenna has tried desperately to escape closes in on her, she must risk her own life to expose the truth--before the Murder House claims another victim.Full of the twists and turns that have made James Patterson the world's #1 bestselling writer, THE MURDER HOUSE is a chilling, page-turning story of murder, money, and revenge.

The object of suspense in this thriller is a two-centuries-old, mostly abandon, creepy house located at No. 7 Ocean Drive in the Hamptons. Former NYPD undercover detective, Jenna Rose Murphy, is hired by her uncle, Landon James, the police chief of the small town of Bridgehampton. Jenna has often been fearful&#8212;of exactly what she&#8217;s not sure&#8212;since her arrival in the town. As a very young girl she remembers visiting the town during several summers with her parents. She recently come to associate the monster mansion with its gargoyles and spears on the roof with her nightmares and sleepless nights. She feels something traumatic took place at the mansion that involved her in some way when she was very young.  Jenna&#8217;s first assignment as the town&#8217;s detective is to investigate the brutal murder of a Hollywood mogul and his girlfriend whose butchered bodies were discovered in the mansion. Six more barbaric murders soon follow. The authors&#8217; clever writing leaves the reader in the dark as to the killer/killers until the very last chapter. Patterson and Ellis developed their characters well. The dialogue is catchy as Jenna leads us on her journey through the mystery with its page turning twists and turns.

I'm tired of female protagonists getting tormented by fellow members of a police force. That plot tool has become incredibly tiresome. Aren't there other ways to create conflict and obstacles for a character to overcome besides total banishment? There were also too many obvious factors that the protagonist didn't see early enough in the plot and her inability to perceive them couldn't be excused by anything in her past. Instead of taking advantage of her returning clarity of mind, she chose to jump to conclusions. So not my favorite read, but not terrible either. This reader just felt frustrated by it.

Review.create({ title: "Apprentice in Death", rating: 5, body: "It’s a race against time as Eve and her team track down a long-distance serial killer in Apprentice in Death. With no ties between the victims, no clues as to when or where the master-apprentice duo will strike next, and a vast number of potential targets in a city like New York, the tension is on high and Eve, Roarke, and company are running themselves ragged to take down the killer.The In Death series can be generally divided between character-centric stories and case-centric ones. Apprentice in Death is the latter, but even though my preference is for books with character growth, I ended up loving this case. It was fascinating to watch the pieces of the puzzle come together, and the more layers that were revealed about the stone-cold killer’s character the more my interested was piqued. The sheer number of potential victims weighs on Eve and her team heavily, and it also added a tenseness to the tale that kept me turning the pages of the book late into the night. It’s a twisted tale, though not in the usual sense; the apprentice is somewhat reminiscent of an earlier In Death killer (and I can’t reveal which character or the book they’re from without spoiling this story). Equally appealing is watching how Eve’s mind works as she makes the connections that will lead her to master and apprentice. While a number of faces old and new (Roarke in particular) are invaluable to solving this case, it’s Eve and the unique way she thinks that is the most fascinating to me.The In Death books can largely be read as standalones, and Apprentice in Death is no exception. That being said, if this is your first foray into the series the mystery will still be appealing, but the small, personal moments in the book might not hold the appeal they do to readers more invested in the characters. And fans of the series, fear not: there are enough personal moments in this book to satisfy and perhaps even tug on your heartstrings a bit. The further into the series we get, the fewer opportunities for big personal drama there are, and that’s ok. The bonds of love and friendship still shine and added to my investment in the tale. All in all, I loved Apprentice in Death and I cannot wait to see what J.D. Robb has in store for Eve and Roarke!KimberlyReview courtesy of Wit and Sin", user_id: user1.id, book_id: book39.id })

It has been a joy to watch Eve open up and see how she has gathered more friends than she knows what to do with. Was so scared that something had happened to Sommerset at Madison Square. Eve got him to stand for the living while she stood for the dead. Not certain what either Roarke or Eve would do without Sommerset.

Many have tried to write from the animal's perspective, but Bruce Cameron has hit it head on.  I've never experienced so many emotions while reading one book.  I laughed, I cried, I cheered.Put in the context of what is going on in my life right now, I was just waiting for A Dog's Purpose.  My son and his wife had to have their 15-year-old golden retriever put to sleep after a long and full life, a short time ago.  Even though I was 1,300 miles away from them at the time, I went through the pain and the grief.  Right now I'm visiting with him and his wife and we started talking about them getting another dog.  Initial reluctance moved on to checking out rescue web sites to starting to make a list of potential new puppies.  And then they found THE ONE.  And so while I was reading A Dog's Purpose, Tucker came to live with my son and his wife.  I can see in Tucker's face the knowledge, the understanding and the love that is embodied in A Dog's Purpose.My son is reading A Dog's Purpose right now and I know he is finding comfort in his old friend's passing in those pages and joy in the new, exuberant life that has joined their household.", user_id: user3.id, book_id: book41.id })
Review.create({ title: "Forever Loyal", rating: 5, body: "A dog does not choose his circumstances. He accepts whatever may come his way. Born to royalty or on the side of a road; he doesn't question his lot. He makes the best of it. Cameron spins one of the most interesting and beautiful novels on how a dog sees the world.When some people say that dogs don't have a soul....look into those eyes and know that it is impossible for that to be true. True love and vast wisdom exude from those soulful eyes. Eyes that may have seen many lives.This is a novel of acceptance, loyalty,survival and greater than anything....true love that never ends.Scientific research has told us that a dog does not remember, that we humanize them to serve our own needs. The research also breaks down every behavior into a rational explanation. All well and good. Science has its place, but can't explain why the Tornado dog from Alabama, separated from his family dragged himself back to the site of his destroyed house towing 2 broken legs.Read this book more than once, buy as many copies as you can get, and give one to each person who knows that a dog is much more than the sum of scientific research.I bought 10 copies and plan on buying more.Sit down in a comfortable chair with your best friend next to you, and don't get up until you have finished this most touching story. Then give your best friend a big hug, his favorite treat and a good long belly rub.Marcy BlumeMidlothian, VA 23113", user_id: user4.id, book_id: book41.id })

Actually three. Soul.Bruce Cameron has brought forth a magnificent, touching piece of a soul's journey through life in search of purpose and meaning. At times hilarious and yet other times heart breaking, Bruce brilliantly weaves a story of a dog and its quest that is told with such heart and humanity that anyone who has ever had a dog (or any pet , for that matter) feels that this truly is how they see us and the world in which they live.The humor is real and effortless. You will find yourself laughing out loud. You will also cry. Real tears born out of your life's memories of pets past and the essential intertwining of souls that exists in no other relationship.That bond (from the dog's perspective) is what brings the true love in this novel to life.Though many dream of writing that one great novel, the difference here is that Bruce Cameron has done it right out of the gate and I have a feeling that there is plenty more where that came from.

The team would learn something, and then someone would summarize it all for them. It seemed to be needlessly padding the book--maybe Michaels had a word minimum she had to hit?

This is a fantastic book which should be unusual when it is the 27 th book in a series.  However, Fern Michaels has a way of making each book unique so that it stands on its own as well as works its way into the series.  In this book, the men and women work together to make amends for things that occurred in the past.Nikki Quinn is finishing up on a rather unique divorce case.  Something about it bothers her.  Neither of the couple seem to really want the divorce.  Amy, who has been hired to work for Nikki&#8217;s firm, and Jeffrey, son of Senator Buck Lambert, seemed to be really in love.  Amy is walking away with nothing at her request while Jeffrey is insisting on a trust being set up for her.  Amy agreed but didn&#8217;t intend to ever touch the trust.  As Jeffrey was leaving last, Buck Lambert burst into Nikki&#8217;s office to try to push his weight around to make sure Amy got nothing from Jeffrey.  Nikki lambasted him for bullying his way into her business and made it perfectly clear that he would get no information about the divorce from her.  As he blasted his way out of the office building, a little lady who was coming in was hurled in with the revolving door.  She had an appointment with Nikki.  In reality, she was the fashionable wife of Buck Lambert, Lavinia, who had come to Nikki to set up a divorce for herself.  She did have some definite instructions which would enable her to be long gone when Buck received the papers.  Something about her entire day bothered her.  She just couldn&#8217;t figure out what it was.  She does know that this divorce will pit her against the Chessmen, a law firm notorious for its major wins for its divorce cases.Where does the Sisterhood come into play with this divorce?", user_id: user18.id, book_id: book42.id })

Whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse. August Pullman was born with a facial difference that, up until now, has prevented him from going to a mainstream school. Starting 5th grade at Beecher Prep, he wants nothing more than to be treated as an ordinary kid&mdash;but his new classmates can&rsquo;t get past Auggie&rsquo;s extraordinary face. WONDER, now a #1&#160;New York Times bestseller and included on the Texas Bluebonnet Award master list, begins from Auggie&rsquo;s point of view, but soon switches to include his classmates, his sister, her boyfriend, and others. These perspectives converge in a portrait of one community&rsquo;s struggle with empathy, compassion, and acceptance. Wonder is the best kids' book of the year, said Emily Bazelon, senior editor at Slate.com and author of Sticks and Stones: Defeating the Culture of Bullying and Rediscovering the Power of Character and Empathy. In a world where bullying among young people is an epidemic, this is a refreshing new narrative full of heart and hope. R.J. Palacio has called her debut novel &ldquo;a meditation on kindness&rdquo; &mdash;indeed, every reader will come away with a greater appreciation for the simple courage of friendship. Auggie is a hero to root for, a diamond in the rough who proves that you can&rsquo;t blend in when you were born to stand out.

I'm not going to try to summarize the story as many other reviewers have done that - I just want to talk about the emotional resonance of the work.The sheer truth of Auggie's journey is what meant the most to me.  There are so many small moments that struck me to the core - e.g. Auggie's feelings about Halloween, the way Auggie has an easier time when his classmates understand that there's more to him than his face, Auggie's struggle to move past his need for coddling, even the food that Auggie eats.  The most emotional moment for me came toward the end of the book when Auggie's father tells him that he loves the way Auggie looks, because that it exactly how my husband and I feel about our son.I wish that everyone would read this book, because it will help them understand the humanity of my son and everyone like him.", user_id: user1.id, book_id: book44.id })

It is very touching, and I think it should be an inspiration to kids to act with character and integrity, but it also lays out scenarios of good kids screwing up, and at times they apologize and others just get back on track.So why only three stars?  I am the mother of a teenage girl with developmental disabilities.  I bought the book because neighborhood children, that have included my daughter for years and been friendly to her in previous summers, have moved on and are no longer desiring her company. It was inevitable, but I wanted to help her see that others have difficult social situations and have a harder time fitting in and being accepted for who they are. The problem is that there are several references in the book to the fact that August doesn't have special needs.  When I read certain parts to my daughter, I felt like it was a further insult to her situation ... like if Auggie had special needs, than acceptance by the school and other kids would be a different matter, but since it is a craniofacial abnormality and not special needs, August should be accepted.It just &#34;rubbed salt in the wounds&#34; so to speak. And, I think the book could have been easily written without those references to &#34;Auggie not having special needs.&#34; It is pretty clear that he is a smart kid without these direct references.My summary is that it is an excellent book, but it may not be the best choice if you are trying to help your special needs child see that other kids have difficulty with acceptance too.", user_id: user7.id, book_id: book44.id })

Some kids use hateful language, and some people suggest that Auggie is mentally deficient.  However, goodness wins out, and readers should find it inspiring and uplifting. Author R.J. Palacio writes the book in multiple voices -- Auggie's, some of his friends', his sister's -- and the different points of view are mostly very well-realized and show the inner feelings of the different characters. Wonder by RJ Palacio was astonishing! I think the book was for grades fifth-eighth grade, and adults would like it.  This book can teach many different lessons. The one that stood out to me was not to judge by the way someone looked but by the inner character of that person.  It is one of the most moving books I have read in a long time, and I am still pretty amazed at how the author wove so much complexity into a story for middle schoolers.Take home messages included, you can count on your parents even if things get tough, sometimes people make mistakes and deserve second chances, sometimes you just have to suck it up and endure and most importantly, in general, things change over time.", user_id: user9.id, book_id: book44.id })

Review.create({ title: "A Little Bit More Outside the Box", rating: 5, body: "Cross-posted on Tween Book BlogWhy I picked it up: I like wise-cracking teens and Norse Gods. Especially together.Why I finished it: I mentioned in another review that Riordan's books seem formulaic; while this one isn't any different in terms of the formula department, Riordan has at least mixed it up a little for his readers by going a little bit more outside the box with his characters. They feel more rounded somehow, like even though they are involved in this supernatural world there is still the real world to contend with as well. The fluidity with which the real world relates to the supernatural seems much more urgent and apparent, perhaps because of the juxtaposition between Magnus and Sam. Magnus is dead, but can still cross over to the real world while Sam is still alive and can cross into the world of the dead. Sam still has family and school and everyday teen problems to deal with on top of whatever supernatural duties go along with being a Valkyrie, helping ground the reader even as we are rocketing among the Nine Worlds. Magnus's wit and sarcasm add a certain spin to the dire situations in which our characters seem to find themselves, keeping the reader eager for the sort of tongue-in-cheek style that has defined the protagonist. I think it's somewhat poignant that Riordan has introduced a gender fluid character to the cast - it shows he's keeping with the times and getting in touch with his audience. Really I think what I got most out of this volume is the idea that we might not be able to change where we came from, but we can define who we are in a way that is true to ourselves and how we want the world to see us. We don't all fit the labels that society wants to place on us - we need to be able to defend our identities and be comfortable in our own skins. We all need to have confidence in who we are and what we believe in, even if it might seem strange or hard to understand. And on the flip side, we need to be understanding and supportive of those around us, even if we don't always agree with their point of view - that's how I see it, in any case. It's a surprisingly fast read considering the book is a hefty 480 pages and I'm eager to see what new adventure and danger Magnus and his friends will face when the third book comes out in the fall.", user_id: user3.id, book_id: book45.id })

Review.create({ title: "Couldn't Put It Down!", rating: 5, body: "Read it in 3 hours flat this evening. Very well written, nice pacing, wonderful character development. Magnus and crew are very wonderful characters to care about during their trials, which makes the story very gripping to read. Unlike his previous series, the direction of the story flows much more smoothly, not having to worry about multiple viewpoints or flat main characters. There is a slight time reference discrepancy, but nothing that takes away from the flow of the story. It was a fantastic addition to a series that started off with a strong first book. Perhaps this is his best written series yet!Now a not complaint, but observation for parents.This series is much more violent than previous Percy Jackson/HoO novels, as the Norse/Heathen mythos is more outright violent than its Greek counterpart. It works well with the type of story Riordan tells, and gives more emotional investment in the plot, but make sure you want your preteen to read about decapitation/gore in such a way. As an adult it added stakes and layers to the story, and was wonderful, but I can see where some parents may be caught off guard by the brutality of some descriptions. Recommend personally for 14+ age range for the casual violent scenes.", user_id: user5.id, book_id: book45.id })

He can also talk to humans...if any of them are willing to listen! After a dramatic escape from a mysterious laboratory, Isaiah is separated from his mischief (which is the word for a mouse family), and has to use his special skills to survive in the dangerous outdoors, and hopefully find his missing family.

Ada Twist, Scientist, from powerhouse team Andrea Beaty and David Roberts, is a celebration of STEM, perseverance, and passion. &#160; Like her classmates, builder Iggy and inventor Rosie, scientist Ada, a character of color, has a boundless imagination and has always been hopelessly curious. Why are there pointy things stuck to a rose? Why are there hairs growing inside your nose? When her house fills with a horrific, toe-curling smell, Ada knows it&rsquo;s up to her to find the source. What would you do with a problem like this? Not afraid of failure, Ada embarks on a fact-finding mission and conducts scientific experiments, all in the name of discovery. But, this time, her experiments lead to even more stink and get her into trouble! &#160; Inspired by real-life makers such as Ada Lovelace and Marie Curie, Ada Twist, Scientist champions girl power and women scientists, and brings welcome diversity to picture books about girls in science. Touching on themes of never giving up and problem solving, Ada comes to learn that her questions might not always lead to answers, but rather to more questions. She may never find the source of the stink, but with a supportive family and the space to figure it out, she&rsquo;ll be able to feed her curiosity in the ways a young scientist should. &#160; Iggy Peck and Rosie Revere have earned their places among the most beloved children&rsquo;s characters, and they have inspired countless kids and adults to follow their dreams and passions. Now in her own charming and witty picture book, determined Ada Twist, with her boundless curiosity for science and love of the question &ldquo;Why?,&rdquo; is destined to join these two favorites.&#160; The book is the perfect tool to remind both young girls and women that they have the intelligence and perseverance to achieve their dreams.", amazon_link: "https://www.amazon.com/Ada-Twist-Scientist-Andrea-Beaty/dp/1419721372", kobo_link: "https://kobo.com", play_link: "https://play.google.com/store/books" })

It's not easy pursuing scientific discovery, but luckily for Ada she has her family's full support once they stop to think about everything this girl dynamo has already discovered in Ada Twist, Scientist (2016) by Andrea Beaty, illustrated by Dave Roberts.Beaty and Roberts continue their delightful series of companion pictures that began with Iggy Peck, Architect and Rosie Revere, Engineer.This time around Ada is inspired by scientists such as Marie Curie and, as her name suggests, Ada Lovelace. While I am very fond of this series, previous installments missed opportunities to include a more diverse cast of characters. The author and illustrator work to correct that here with Ada and her family. Ada is a thoughtful, intelligent, black girl and aspiring scientist--something we need to see more often in picture books (and other books for children and teens).While Ada encounters some pitfalls on her way to becoming a scientists she remains curious and persistent. This story includes rhyming text that rolls trippingly off the tongue and cartoon-like illustrations filled with details to draw readers into the story.

As the mom of a kid with autism, I really loved that Ada is a little bit different, and her parents have to adjust their parenting style and expectations to meet her needs. It's great for kids to see that sometimes parents have to make changes too.2) I love the emphasis on a curious mind and asking lots of questions. I think a lot of times kids are discouraged from really asking lots of WHY because it annoys adults. Curiosity is what leads to great discoveries. I love Ada's innovation in creating tools to test her scientific hypotheses.3) The style. Let's face it - these books are just oozing with style.

I was very excited for this newest addition to Ms. Lila Greer's 2nd grade class because the principal character is a young minority girl and she loves science!  Unfortunately the book doesn't read as easily as Iggy Peck or Rosie Revere.  The story line is also pretty flat.  And while the things that caused insecurities for Iggy and Rosie were basically in not being accepted, Ada's passion has her being very messy - and writing all over the walls - and her parents are the ones that can't accept it.  In the end, her parents accept it but I didn't get the sense that there was teaching in that.  I'm all about accepting the curiosity and discovery and becoming a part of the love of research, but just think there's a better way to express that than a character writing all over the walls?  As with the previous books there are great illustrations and in the last page, you see the parents have gotten her a big long wheel of paper that she can write out to her heart's content so parents can show their kids, that writing on the wall to satisfy the curiousity isn't the BEST approach.All in all, it's got the notions of the previous awesome stories, but this one falls a bit short.

I actually bought it for myself, excited to share the experience with our new granddaughter. I still hear, and love, my parents' dramatic, animated deliveries of our favorite books. Dr Seuss. Roald Dahl. I wanted to create similar memories!But then I thought it might be an even better gift for our son in law. He seemed a little puzzled at first... a children's book with no pictures? And for a three month old?? Then he got it, and really ran with it before the wrapping paper hit the ground.Well, it will certainly be one of our best memories of our first grandchild and her father. She was delighted by his exaggerated performance, which made us all even more engaged. What a feeling!!This book will &#34;grow&#34; with kids... this infant loved it on a very basic level as would any toddler. Five year olds will be a bit more clued in, and so on. Aside from learning the value of enthusiastic interpretations in the spoken word, the love and bonding will be priceless.Thank you for such a wonderful gift, Mr Novak!

Review.create({ title: "Great for kids of many ages!", rating: 5, body: "A huge hit with my 8-yr old niece and 5-yr old nephew. The only drawback is that kids will ask you to read it again...and again...and again...and again, and then some more.  My 2.5 yr old son also loves it and runs around the house reciting the lines from the book!  You can't go wrong with this as a gift.I read some of the negative comments and felt frustrated that many people didn't explain why they didn't like it.  So, here is why I LIKE the book:I believe that the main point of this book is to help kids understand that books don't have to have pictures to be fun, interesting, exciting and funny.  This is accomplished in a way that makes kids feel like they are the ones in control. And, we parents know all about kids wanting to feel like they are the ones in control, don't we?  Here is how books work. Everything the words say, the person reading the book HAS to say. No matter what.  This book is set up as an adult reading to a kid so... the kid feels like he/she is the one in control.  The book appeals to the logic of a child, which is what it should do - it's a children's book, and in a child's world, silliness is at the top of the charts. You can see the cranks turning in kids' heads when you read it, because they are trying to picture all of the silly things you're saying.  One last note is that I also see this book as a bridge to the kind of reading they'll do in the future: books with no pictures, where they will have to use their imaginations to make their own pictures in their heads.", user_id: user4.id, book_id: book50.id })

I was a little cautious because the negative reviews implied a number of lessons I did not necessarily want to provide my granddaughter.  Well, some of those reviewers either received a completely different book, or have some grudge against real life and positive messages.  The book is about a young, shy girl who makes her own gadgets out of junked items.  Yes, an Uncle laughs at her spray cheese can hat device to keep snakes away.  And, yes the uncle is a zoo keeper.  And, the uncle's laughter hurts her feelings and causes her to stop working on her inventions for a while.  But, the story is about bouncing back from disappointments and failures, not about a mythical perfect world where all Uncles are perfect and there are no zoos, and helicoptering parents are ever present to protect you.  So, an Aunt also laughs at Rosie's flying machine invention failure. And, Rosie is disappointed and decides to stop inventing. But, the Aunt's laughter is based on amazement, or enthusiasm, or perhaps just on seeing a spinning cheese spraying contraption try to fly.  The Aunt embraces Rosie and her failed machine and teaches her that failure is part of the process of succeeding.  So, this is good book that promotes a good lesson.  (I have to admit there seems to be a strong canned spray cheese component since that shows up in two &#34;inventions&#34;.

So I was incredibly excited for the new one. I keep wondering if there's a therapy group where all the disgruntled fans can congragate and weep together. I'm also refusing to consider in cannon as it was not JKR herself who penned.  What they did to the INTEGRITY of these characters. I'm sick over it.  The entire 7 book series was about friendship, love and loyalty, and Harry knew that; and most importantly, knew that's what made him different from V. You're telling me, he, Ron and Herm  didn't continue to live and instil those values in their children? Rose was a bully, who was prejudice against someone without knowing them first.  Harry would never said he wished his kid wasn't his, or sacrificed his kid's only friendship over gosip. Harry wouldn't have choosen work over time with his family, which after all he'd been through WAS ALL HE EVER WANTED.If someone were to ask me, what is your favorite thing about Harry Potter?, I would hands down reply: Harry Potter's moral integrity, that is the heart of the series. It's his choosing to sacrifice himself for what is good. It's choosing friendship over suspicion. It's a defiant effort to turn towards the pain of loving and losing, then choosing not to love at all. It's choosing to do what right, and best for others even when it hurts, is inconvenient, or scary. It's fighting for truth and justice, even when you're the only one doing it.  And when you move away from those central themes, the integrity of who we know Harry (and friends) to have PROVEN himself to be, you destroy Harry Potter and all that he stood for for 7 books.  This new book is the worst kind of trash, the one that destroys the soul of our hero.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user3.id, book_id: book55.id })

I grew up with Harry, I went to midnight premiers of the books and movies. I was so excited for this play. I wanted to like it. I really really did. If you are a fan I would say read it and form your own opinion. Here is what I thought:-  Where was George?-  Where was Teddy? Because he was in the station in th epilogue.-  Where was Hugo? You know the other child Ron and Hermione have.-  Lily and James Potter&#8230; MIA for most of the play. Like James? Was he even in it?-  Why was Ron running the joke shop? He is an Auror. WHAT HAPPENED TO GEORGE? WHY WASN&#8217;T HE RUNNING THE SHOP?!-  Let&#8217;s talk about Ron. Why was he so non-Ron like? His character, all jokes no supporting and listening to Harry and Hermione. Also he is hardly in the play.-  Harry&#8217;s relationship with Albus. Everything about this is upsetting.o  In the last book when they are dropping off the children at the Hogwarts express, the kids are genuinely confused as to why everyone is looking at them and Ron makes a joke saying &#8220;I&#8217;m famous&#8221;. It is deduced that the kids do not know the extent of everything their parents went through to save the world. Yet Albus feel the weight of his dad&#8217;s legacy. Huh.o  Then we have Harry SEPARATING Albus and Scorpious. Let&#8217;s go back to that epilogue where they all see Draco with his family and a joke gets made about not playing with his son. Which then Hermione corrects and Ron says to beat him on test but not to get too cozy and marry him. Again, making it seem that everything in the past is in the past. Then there is Harry&#8217;s history of friends at Hogwarts. He knows. He would not separate his son from his ONLY friend.-  Albus choosing Slytherin for a friend? Awesome.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user12.id, book_id: book55.id })

Review.create({ title: "NOT the eighth story, very disappointing, not going to read this again", rating: 2, body: "I'm a HUGE HP nerd, just trust me on that. So even though I knew it was just a play script that J.K didn't write but liked it enough to let them put her name on it, I had to read it for myself.There is no way this should be officially thought of as the 8th story. She ended 7 fine and this just completely ruins that epilogue, she should never have let this be considered part of the HP universe. I went into this with low expectations and I was still a little disappointed. The characters don't act like they would if this were written by J.K. or any normal fan that know and love them as much as a lot of us do. The story skips over a bunch of things-i get it, it's a play... But the first few years at Hogwarts in the beginning were just a waste. You get to see some of the characters you love but others that you assume will be in it are completely ignored. I mean, the story has Hogwarts in it, where is Neville? Where is Hagrid? You're left completely in the dark about what has happened to a lot of these characters, not even a mention of them if they are alive or dead. The story itself is a bit ridiculous and is completely predictable. I won't give any spoilers but the whole thing is just one person after another whining about their daddy issues.Read this if you are curious and make your own decisions, but for me I wish I hadn't. I re-read 1-7 ever year (at least once a year, if not 2-3 times) unfortunately this book will sit on my shelf and never be read again. :-(", user_id: user14.id, book_id: book55.id })

We pre-ordered the book during the Summer and it arrived the day of it's release. People don't notice the small stuff but I do. As I took the book out of the package I noticed the book has a smooth texture on the front cover. The book cover in general has a smooth grip- like texture, lol. I always love the smell of a new book but the smooth outside texture of the book adds a good feature to the book.The book has comic like pictures, but don't think it's a comic strip type book overall. It is a well worded book from the first page to the last page (217 pages overall) each page has a complete word filled page but the pictures adds to the imagination of the child reading this book. My son started reading this book series at 8. He's now 10 and he LOVES this book series so much he looks forward to the new books that come out and every once in a while re-reads the older book series. We even have family movie nights and I don't mind watching the couple movies that have been made from the &#34;Diary of A Whimpy Kid&#34; book series. I'm 32 and I find parts of the movie hillarious so I can only imagine reading this book as a kid. I can't say enough good things about this book or any other book from the series. If you're a parent like me, you'd rather watch your child read VS. Playing video games or watching TV programs. At least while reading it engages a child's imagination as well as improving their spelling. Some studies has shown that kids, especially those that are more visual learners,  spelling improves the more they read. :)I will be on the lookout for more books by this same Author  (Jeff Kinney).

It wasn't quite as magical as Harry Potter in the sense that the focus of the magic and paranormal events is quite dark. The Harry Potter series is balanced with the benevolent and the beautiful. Attacks and battles happen in Harry Potter, but not in every other chapter as in Miss Peregrine's Children (as we've read so far.) Miss Peregrine's Peculiar Children series tends more toward the morbid and the mysterious, with lots of blood, attacks and bodies. Now my girls are going through a &#34;spooky stuff and bad guys&#34; phase (as a follow in from fairies and fashion) which is why I got this series, to be honest. They're quite happy to get all this inspiration for their drawings and games. But if you have children who are more sensitive, keep in mind that this series does include gore enough to cause nightmares and anxiety.Personally I have found the books too violent for my tastes. I was a little uneasy about this given I was reading the book to my girls, but it didn't seem to bother them. Now we're not a family who has a problem with profanity, but I think this series is a little heavy on it for pre-teen readers, and this is something I would have liked to have known beforehand. My girls thought the language was hilarious (possibly they thought their Mummy reading such words aloud was even more funny) and we haven't had any problems with them copying it or anything.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user13.id, book_id: book58.id })

There was a pretty big cliffhanger at the end of the fourth book and an even BIGGER one at the end of this one. I don't mind the occasional cliffhanger, but there needs to be some resolution. In this book it felt like we were just tying up lose ends from the last book, and then we were finally getting to the point we were before, and then boom, the book ended. Just as we were getting somewhere, all the progress stopped. I can't blame you for keeping us in suspense though! all in all, I enjoyed the book, but I JUST GET REALLY HUNG UP ON ENDINGS! They can really make it or break it for me.I also wish more characters from the last book could've been incorporated into this one. For instance, Arthur and Merlin were a big part of the last book! I felt like there should've been more than just half a chapter about them.I read really fast,( I also think the fifth book could've been longer! It did not feel like 439 pages!) so after that I finished the fifth book, I instantly went looking for the next one. I couldn't find anywhere that there's even going to be a sixth book! I really hope there's an update on it soon, because there wasn't even supposed to be a another book and I need at least a confirmation that there is one!I recommend reading this book if you have already read the rest of this series, but if you haven't you DEFINITELY need to go back and read the first four, or you will be REALLY confused. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because of the ending, but I still loved the book anyway and hope the sixth comes out soon!

The characters were all spot-on, and I loved getting to see Connor's imagination through his stories and how they reflected the Bailey twins's adventures. The writing was humorous and fast-paced - there was never a slow moment in the story. The plot was exciting and suspenseful, a perfect read for kids of all ages. I fell in love with this series a while ago and am thrilled that there will, indeed, be another book in the series after this one. Overall, an exciting, action-packed, super creative, funny, clever fifth installment to the Land of Stories!Reviewed by a 12 year old girlOscar's Review: I really loved this book. In every chapter when you thought something was going well, the ship would sink and everything would be submerged and the story would be shaken. I really don't have that much to say about this book because I love it so much, but I do have one thing: most who read this book will love it as they've loved, in turn, the first, second, third, and fourth books in the series. There was also a HUGE, interesting, and unexpected twist that really shook up the story and increased the suspense and excitement levels by a tenfold. I think this book would really appeal to reluctant readers because it is an action-packed, fast-paced fantasy story that pulls you into the book from the start.Reviewed by a 9 year old boy(reviewed by the Kid Book Reviewers, siblings ages 9 and 12 @ (...))", user_id: user12.id, book_id: book59.id })

(He also wrote V for Vendetta, the League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Superman: Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?, Lost Girls, an issue of American Splendor with Harvey Pekar, an historic run on Swamp Thing, and much, much more – [...]NOTE: There is more than one version of this tale:#1 – the original Batman: the Killing Joke (1988).#2 – the Deluxe Edition (2008).  This is probably the most common one at this point.  While Brian Bolland drew the 48-page story, it was colored by John Higgins.  Dissatisfied with the results, Bolland re-colored the entire story, including taking the color out of the flashback sequences completely, rendering those pages black and white (with one character in red).  This edition also prints Bolland’s black and white story “An Innocent Guy,” now presented in color, as well as an introduction by Tim Sale, and an epilogue by Bolland.(For a side-by-side comparison of these two editions, go here: [...])#3 – Batman Noir: the Killing Joke (2016).  This edition was released August 9, 2016, and it may be the best one yet.  It presents both stories from the Deluxe Edition in stark black and white (but not the introduction or epilogue).  The black and white gives the story a very different feel – a somewhat timeless feel – and that can only be a good thing considering the importance of this story in the comics canon.  This edition also includes a series of covers Bolland has drawn for Batman, also presented in black and white.", user_id: user2.id, book_id: book62.id })
Review.create({ title: "One Bad Day", rating: 3, body: "What does one say about Alan Moore and Brian Bolland’s THE KILLING JOKE that hasn’t been said? Recently it’s come back under the comic-book-reading-public’s scrutiny due to a certain recent internet crap-storm over a certain controversial comic-book cover relating to one of it’s key plot points. I’ll get that out of the way by saying that the huffy indignation over the book’s extreme content is misplaced, as are shoe-horned dialogues over all-too-real social issues, and its relation to/”depiction of” real-life horrors. As to what happens to Barbara...I can see those associations, for sure, though that particular grimmest, ugliest interpretation is largely read-into-matters, with little if anything in the presented images and text to support the argument that that’s what happened. If you keep up with this sort of thing, you know what I mean. The grim proceedings remain disturbing, though nowhere near as graphic or over-the-line as you might have been led to believe.Taken on its own terms as a work of storytelling, the problem with THE KILLING JOKE now isn’t (mostly) in the work itself, but how in the years since, more importance and gravity have been thrown on its slender back than it was ever meant to hold. Someone reading it for the first time now, following its reputation, could easily be left going, “Huh?”As a brief 80‘s superhero/supervillain/psychological-horror comic, it holds up well, a graphic-novella, maybe the length of two individual issues. The story is simple but effective: The Joker makes it crueler and more personal than ever for Batman, Batgirl, and Gordon, in the name of proving the point of his deranged, nihilistic world view, intercut with flashbacks of the Joker’s tragic origins (Christopher Nolan clearly yanked a lot of ideas straight from this, fleshed them out and refined them for his and Heath Ledger’s take on the Joker in the film THE DARK KNIGHT). The artwork is holds up best of all -- stunning and haunting in places -- as harrowing and macabre. At the time, the presentation and the grim, extreme themes dealt with were groundbreaking for a mainstream comic, introducing a lot of ideas and approaches no one had seen before, revitalizing a getting-tired era. Compared to what’s become common-place since, not to mention meatier, similarly acclaimed, groundbreaking works of the same day, it’s just not as fresh or shocking as it used to be. In some places, it now feels, if anything, a tad quaint.How the writing does/doesn’t hold up: virtually everything to do with exploring the Joker’s character-arc/outlook on life, and how his maniacal plan unfolds before the reader, remains pretty brilliant. Some of his wicked monologues belong in the audition-books of aspiring actors trying out for villain roles. Its the heroes’ side of things where it now feels thin, underdeveloped, and ultimately unconvincing. The un-fleshed-out briefness of the work is part of the problem, though really, this is a story where the bad guy is the true protagonist, who the author is clearly most fascinated by/invested in, and his heart’s just nor really in it with the good guys. I don’t for a minute buy Gordon’s demand of “We have to show him that our way works!” or Batman’s final attempts to reason with the Joker. Even complaints of Barbara/Batgirl being reduced to a “woman-in-refrigerator&#34; victim-plot-device (the one caveat I’ll grant the recent detractors) might have been fixed were her traumatic experience and its aftermath given just a bit more breathing room. One senses Moore was hampered on this end both by length-restriction and DC editorial policies of the day regarding the handling of their most lucrative characters, so they come off a bit like morose self-parody...More would go on to explore some of these ideas with more freedom in WATCHMEN.So yeah, THE KILLING JOKE, still worth a read for Batman/Joker fans, to be sure, though whether you’re picking it up for the first time or nostalgically revisiting it, I recommend subduing your expectations.", user_id: user3.id, book_id: book62.id })

However (second), I really tried to like this story, but I didn't.  Not because of the content or the layout; I think I was drawn in and taken over by the hype.  I knew the gist of the story from the Batman cartoon movies, the video games, and other Batman-related stories and shows involving Oracle.  That's what made me want to read it.  I read Battle for the Cowl and other titles; all of them awesome.  I guess I was just expecting more from this story than girl gets shot, dad gets humiliated, batman finds the joker and beats him up, case closed.  Where was the Detective?  There was a little bit if that before the signal went up and he got an invitation, but that was it.  Where were the interim fights before getting to The Joker?  I was looking for a darker, longer, more complex story.  Also, I didn't get or like the joke at the end or the short story.  In my world, Batman and The Joker don't share a laugh.  It's...unnatural.  And the snuff fantasy seemed equally pointless.  So like I wrote, I tried to like this story, but the hype was too real and the story fell a little flat.", user_id: user4.id, book_id: book62.id })

Review.create({ title: "Quite possibly the most beautiful graphic novel I’ve ever read. ALL THE STARS AND MOONS.", rating: 5, body: "**  Trigger warning for threats of rape. **They luxuriated sinfully in that most beautiful of all things: The written word.###All those stories you have told, all those wonderful stories…They are nothing to OUR STORY. People will tell it in years to come…And they will say, that was a story about Love.And about two brave girls who wouldn’t take s*** from anyone.###Lesson: Men are false. And they can get away with it.Also, don’t murder your sister, even by accident. Sisters are important.###Once upon a time, thousands of years ago, in a land called Early Earth, there lived two star-crossed lovers: Cherry, a fair and lovely young woman from the Empire of Migdal Bavel, and her maid, Hero.Despite her vaguely masculine name, Hero was a young woman as well – and a servant and runaway, at that – both conditions which conspired against their love. Cherry’s father insisted she marry a man who could provide for her; and so, after dodging his demands for one blissful summer (spent in the arms of Hero, of course), Cherry finally acquiesced. Luckily, Hero was able to accompany Cherry to the castle of her new husband, Jerome, where she stayed on as Cherry’s maid – and her secret lover. Like many of the men in Migdal Bavel, Jerome was a rather dim-witted and arrogant misogynist, you see, so Hero and Cherry were able to outwit him with minimal effort.And then one day Jerome made a foolish bet with his friend Manfred, a man a little less stupid but a whole lot crueler than himself. If Manfred could seduce his ‘obedient and faithful’ (*snort!*) wife Cherry, then Manfred would win Jerome’s castle. If not, Manfred’s castle would become Jerome’s. Jerome would feign a business trip, giving Manfred a full one hundred days to execute his fiendish plot.Being an amateur eavesdropper, Hero overheard the men’s conversation and tipped her lover off. Knowing that Manfred would take Cherry’s maidenhood by force if necessary (read: rape), the women hatched their own plan to keep Manfred at bay: with stories. For Hero is a gifted and cunning storyteller who hails from a long line of gifted and cunning female storytellers.So for one hundred nights, Hero enthralls Manfred – and their guards, and indeed all of Migdal Bavel – with tales of madness, lust, deception, bravery, fealty, and ingenuity. Stories about sisters, fathers and daughters, kings and their subjects, men and women and moons and lovers. Stories of how the world came to be, and how it was corrupted: by a daughter named Kiddo and her father, the god Bird Man. But little does Hero know that her and Cherry’s story will prove the most epic and revolutionary of them all.THE ONE HUNDRED NIGHTS OF HERO is simply breathtaking. Honestly, it just might be the most beautiful and moving graphic novel I’ve ever read. I love fairy tell retellings, and we’re treated to several rather lovely ones, thanks to Hero. But THE ONE HUNDRED NIGHTS OF HERO is so much more than this: there are stories within stories within stories, and by the book’s end, they all converge in a way that feels both masterful and magical. Much like Hero, Isabel Greenberg has the gift of gab, as Manfred would say. She also has a sly and sometimes dark sense of humor, which adds a little feminist levity to a story that can be grim and depressing at times.The artwork is lovely, with bold graphics (that kind of brought to mind KILL BILL, if I’m being honest) and punches of color to emphasize a point. It feels almost primitive, like the artwork of early h. sapiens – a few steps up from cave art, maybe. Rough and angular but also beautiful, in its own way. It fits well with the “Early Earth” setting.Hero and Cherry’s love forms the heart of the story. In a society that’s deeply homophobic and rooted in misogyny (some of the funniest/saddest moments involve women being persecuted and ultimately executed for reading, writing, witchcraft, and general “sassiness”), there’s nothing worse than a smart and opinionated woman – except two smart and opinionated women who love each other, and have no need of men. Hero and Cherry’s fate was sealed from the start; in a world where women just can’t win, Jerome and Manfred’s wager was a darned-if-you-do, darned-if-you-don’t Catch-22 situation. (Think about ye ole swimming test for witches. Strip and bind a woman and toss her in the water. If she floats, she’s a witch and must be executed. If she drowns, she’s declared innocent. Um, thanks?)Yet their love – and the great love of The Sisterhood of Secret Storytellers, or The Sisterhood of Women Who Won’t Take S*** from Anyone, or whatever you want to call it – endures. No, it does more than that: it transcends. It shines immortal, just like the three moons and the five dancing stones of Hero’s fairy tales.But the story’s fist – the one that ultimately smashes the patriarchy of Migdal Bavel – lies in the power of storytelling. THE ONE HUNDRED NIGHTS OF HERO is nothing if not a love letter: to the tellers of stories, no matter what form they take (authors, poets, songwriters, painters, playwrights, sculptors, you name it!), and the adoring audiences who carry their tales with them, wherever they go, thus becoming storytellers in their own right. A well-crafted story has the power to inspire compassion and empathy; to topple the existing social order, challenge the victor’s version of history, and make the world a better place. Seeing yourself in a story is to see yourself, your very existence, validated; to see a different way of walking around in the world. The girls and women of Migdal Bavel? Of Little Rock, Arkansas and Chingola, Zambia and Jēkabpils, Latvia? They need that. We all do.Some of my most cherished stories remind me of the one line in the one story I cherish above all others: the ghost’s entreaty to Mary, upon her escape from the world of the dead, to “Tell them stories.” Storytelling is a nothing short of a superpower – and it’s one that Hero wields with grace and skill.Ditto: Isabel Greenberg. THE ONE HUNDRED NIGHTS OF HERO is a story that we need now more than ever; a story that I’ll return to time and again in the next few years, and probably beyond. A story for the ages, as they say.** Full disclosure: I received a free copy of this book for review from the publisher. **", user_id: user1.id, book_id: book63.id })

Flipping through the pages with large text marking each chapter heading makes this graphic novel feel like a silent film brought onto the page.Bold drawings and attention to historic detail set this retelling apart and mark it as a real charmer.

Review.create({ title: "An exhilirating read", rating: 5, body: "Usually great books are either turned into mediocre films or else great films are made from mediocre books (and we won't even get into the sordid details of the novelizations).  Fight Club is one of the rare instances where a great film was made from a great book.  It is perhaps unfair to mention the film version while discussing the book as they are actually two very different animals.  (And animal is the right word -- perhaps uniquely amongst contemporary novelists, Chuck Palahniuk writes novels that seem to live in the reader's hands, often threatening at any minute to lunge for the throat.)  While most of the film's incidents are in the book and much of the razor-sharp dialouge is reproduced directly from the page, the book actually has a far greater satiric edge than the film.  Whereas the film used the story as a celebration of nihilism, the book is far too self-aware to allow itself to truly celebrate anything.  As such, it becomes less a call to action and more a devastatingly real portrait of a society that has become so commercialized and codified that even the once primal act of revolution becomes just another submission to pop culture.Fight Club is the story of an unnamed narrator, an insomniac yuppie who spends his days helping insurance companies get out of having to pay their claims.  He wanders through a meaningless life until he discovers the emotional release of attending therapy groups for people suffering from various deadly (and rather embarressing) diseases -- all of which the narrator pretends to have.  When the arrival of another faker (the wonderfully dark Marla Singer, whose role is far less central in the book than in the film), the narrator finds even the shallow comfort of testicular cancer self-help groups has been taken away from him.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user9.id, book_id: book66.id })

Review.create({ title: "Ghosts", rating: 5, body: "My oldest daughter is nine years old, and she loves reading.  She has started reading novels, but her favorite genre has always been graphic novels.  Raina Telgemeier has always been my daughter’s favorite author; she has all of Telgemeier’s books, and even met her a few years ago.  Needless to say, my daughter has been looking forward to Ghosts for months.Ghosts is Telgemeier’s newest graphic novel.  Teenage protagonist Cat is not very happy about having to move to the small town of Bahia de la Luna, but her little sister Maya has cystic fibrosis and the climate will help her breathe better.  Cat learns that the whole town is really into Dia de los Muertos; she thinks this is silly, but Maya really wants to meet a real ghost.There is a boy in the story, Cat’s friends tease her about Carlos liking her, but the focus is not on a romantic relationship.  Instead, there is an emphasis on friendship; Carlos shows Cat and Maya around the town, and he is the first one to tell them about the ghosts who live near the mission.It looks like this book might be categorized as “scary”, but it’s more poignant than anything else.  Maya has some health scares, and she is preoccupied with her own mortality; that’s why she wants to meet a ghost.  That’s not something that Cat wants to think about, but she also worries about Maya.  I also appreciated that the girls try to connect with their Mexican heritage.Ghosts is a wonderful book.  I would recommend this book to just about anyone.  My daughter devoured this book in a matter of hours.  I read it as well, and I’m always so impressed with what Telgemeier can do without using prose.  This is a masterfully crafted book- it’s about family and friendship… and of course, ghosts.  You’ll have to read the book if you want to find out if Ghost are real.  My daughter and I have read all of Telgemeier’s books, and we agree that this is her best one yet!", user_id: user1.id, book_id: book68.id })

I truly wanted to like this book. Unfortunately, it presents a dismal--if not catastrophic--depiction of life with cystic fibrosis. Specifically, a quick visit to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation's website ([...]) would highlight several key facts:- There have been tremendous advances in treatment, including new medications that target the underlying cause of CF instead of simply relieving symptoms;- Currently, over half of people in the US with CF are over 18 years of age;- 50% of children born in 2015 are expected to live longer than 45 years.Even though no single individual or book can represent an entire illness, it can cause damage to present a grim depiction without even claiming &#34;Maya was sicker than most kids her age with cystic fibrosis.&#34; I am concerned about how children with CF will perceive their illness after reading this, and whether they will feel more limited by their condition than reality suggests. Many children with CF attend school regularly, participate in extracurricular activities, grow up, go to college, and have families of their own. I know several of them.

It beautifully captures that period in a teen's life when social-awkwardness and orthodontic-care collide, causing emotional and physical trauma.Telgemeier is a true talent, and confidently displays a skill with her artistic tools that I haven't seen since the heyday of For Better or for Worse. In fact, the author credits Lynn Johnston as an influence...It shows.There is a deft power to Telgemeier's narrative -- there are times when it's a little heartbreaking to read -- going to junior-high school can (at times) be hard.

Review.create({ title: "Raina's great idea", rating: 5, body: "Let me tell you a little something about The Baby-Sitters Club.  When the series first came out in the 1980s I was like millions of other little girls around the country.  I wolfed those puppies down like they was popcorn.  Couldn't get enough of them.  Ann M. Martin (who later went on to garner herself a Newbery Honor or two) only intended to write four books (one for each club member) but popular demand was so strong that she started writing more and more and more.  If you were to walk into your local library you'd find dog-eared, yellowing, crumbling paperback editions.  The series has never been republished, so libraries are forced to hold onto the dying original copies with their lamentable late 80s/early 90s hair and fashion.  But do these covers deter the kiddies from reading them?  Hardly.  My library shelves literally cannot keep these puppies in stock.  Put a new one (which is to say, a donated one) on the shelf and VOOM!  It's gone the next day.Which is why the people at Scholastic are geniuses.  Right now I am holding in my hot little hands a brand-spanking new Baby-Sitters Club book.  It's the first book in the series and it has been utterly and completely graphic-novelized (is that a word?).  Scholastic has been veeery slowly cornering the market on high-quality literary graphic novels for children.  I'm not talking about superhero comics or manga or any of that run-of-the-mill material.  I'm talking about things like Jeff Smith's, Bone, done in full color twelve-episode editions.  Really high quality stuff.  Now they've given us The Baby-Sitter's Club in graphic novel form and the timing could not be better.  At this moment in time million of women who grew up with these books are now having children of their own.  It makes me feel old, but it's true.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user7.id, book_id: book71.id })

Well, when I was eight or nine, I picked this up and read the whole thing without a problem.Now I'm fourteen and I still love the books.  They contain nothing inappropriate - no language, sexual content, violence, and only minor drug usage.  And when the rare BSC situation with drinking or smoking involved comes up, the character narrating the book clearly explains that it's a bad thing to do.  There's also a bit of racism, but no bad language or anything - just stuff like people avoiding blacks.  But this stuff is explained in the books to be wrong, too.So, there's nothing that will turn kids into bad people or make them know bad things.  The books are written in a great, flowing style, and each one is unique.  Sometimes big tragedies occur, but the girls support each other and pull through in the end.This book was definitely the best one in the series.  Though I only own about ten of the books, I've picked up most of the other ones from the library, so I can tell how good this is compared to the others.  Sure, they're great, but this one beats them out.It's narrated by character Kristy, who gets a great idea.  She and her friends Mary Anne and Claudia, plus Claudia's new friend Stacey, are going to start a baby-sitting club!  They encounter lots of trouble in this book, like pesky kids, people who want them to sit for dogs, and Kristy's worst nightmare......Watson Brewer, whom her mother is dating - and might even marry.  Kristy hates Watson and thinks his kids, Karen and Andrew, are probably brats, though she's never met them.

Review.create({ title: "Excellent graphic novel! Stays true to the original series.", rating: 5, body: "I loved the Baby-Sitters Club books as an 8 year old, and I am so glad to see them being published as graphic novels. I purchase two copies of this- one for myself and one for my 11 year old niece. We are starting to get into graphic novels as a way to help her dyslexic brother associate words and pictures. She was really excited to see a graphic novel for girls. I should clarify that these books are not *just* for girls- but they certainly appeal to my niece more than X-Men or traditional comics. Also, I should clarify that this book is not a comic- it is a graphic novel. This means that it is a genuine novel that has been heavily illustrated. Thus, if you consider comics low-brow literature, you may still want to consider a graphic novel. Essentially, the entire original story is here, with a lot of original dialogue. The storyline is the same and the characters are the same.There are a lot of graphic novels that I do not care for, because of the illustrations. This novel was illustrated by the same woman who illustrated &#34;Smile.&#34; The pictures and text are very clear.Some people are complaining the story lines are not appropriate for younger elementary. I think when these were published they were aimed at Middle School aged kids- since the kids in the books are all in 6th, 7th, and 8th grades.  I remember reading the original ones as a 9 year old, and it was my first introduction to a lot of new concepts, like divorce, deafness, and diabetes- but to be fair, these are all things I hear my elementary students at school talk to their friends about.

Review.create({ title: "not as good as the regular Star Wars or Vader series", rating: 3, body: "As you know, Disney bought Marvel some time ago, and then Disney bought the Star Wars franchise as well, so it only makes sense that Marvel would return to publishing Star Wars comics.  I have to be honest, I’ve been pleased with virtually every title Marvel has released belonging to the Star Wars universe, and Han Solo is no exception.This limited series takes place soon after the first destruction of the Death Star.  The premise is rather simple – Han takes on a mission given to him by Leia, whom he seemingly can’t refuse.  He is to rescue some embedded Rebel spies posing as Imperial loyalists.  A famous space race is due to occur near the very planets he is to rescue Leia’s agents, and so Han will use the race as a cover for his real mission.  There’s only one problem – one of those supposed Alliance members is actually a traitor, but they don’t know which one!Han Solo offers no backstory concerning the icon.  It does not touch upon the origin of his friendship with Chewbacca.  In other words, it steers very clear of any meaty topics the impending movie will likely address.However, that’s not to say the book is a failure or boring.  Quite the opposite!  In fact, I think this book does a wonderful job establishing an important shift in Han.I just watched Episodes IV, V, and VI with my young daughters, and I noticed that Han went from being a snarky, selfish pirate to a loyal, selfless hero rather quickly.  Of course, those are movies and have to operate by a different standard of pacing, but when watched in succession it’s a bit jolting.This series showcases the struggle taking place within Han Solo.  He grapples throughout the book not only with doing the right thing, but also with introspection concerning why he’s doing the right thing at all.  Best of all?  Like Huck Finn, Han has a habit of acting heroically when he doesn’t have time to think.  There is a heart of gold under all that scruffiness, and this book makes a point to shine a spotlight upon it.Furthermore, we hear a lot in the movies about what a great pilot Han is.  This book takes that to heart while illustrating Han’s skill on multiple occasions.  The race, called the Dragon Void, is designed to disable, even injure, the participants, and so Han must outrace, outthink, and outmaneuver his opponents, all while dealing with the Empire as well as a potential traitor on his own ship.But he does this with his usual swagger, charm, and aloofness.  Han Solo will never stand up front and center and declare himself a hero; he will typically do the right thing while self-deprecating and playing up an aspect of reluctance.  Because of this, the book helps bridge the gap between Han Solo of Star Wars and Han Solo of The Empire Strikes Back.  It hints at the good man into which Han will evolve.It also works to establish a bit more of Han and Leia’s relationship.  Neither of these two individuals are likely to throw themselves at someone, yet, honestly, the movies progress their relationship along at a pretty fast pace.  The book does an excellent job of inching their romance along, slowly, awkwardly, even confrontationally.  But, by story’s end, there is a spark, an acknowledgement that an epic love story is about to begin.The art, by the way, is very good.  Mark Brooks has truly captured the characters’ likenesses from film without making them appear too rigid.  His spacecraft are fun while appearing consistent with established mythology and his aliens are varied and interesting.  Best of all, he conveys motion well, especially in regards to the race.  It’s very important that comic book artists are able to literally move a story along from panel to panel, and Brooks manages to service Liu’s pacing well.If you’re a Star Wars or Han Solo fan, this book will not disappoint.  I know on the surface it seems a little superficial with the clich&eacute;d race plot, but Liu offers some deeply interesting characterization and motivation for Han Solo that only enriches the character and grounds his actions in the films.", user_id: user3.id, book_id: book72.id })

However, while One Punch Man's premise can seem dull on the surface, ONE's brilliant writing and Yusuke's Murata's perfectionist drawing style, they simply make it work. As while Saitama himself can seem dull to watch fight, fighting isn't all he does. He struggles to pay the bills, rise up the ranks in the Hero association by doing good deeds and fighting monsters far below his level, and helps train the cyborg Genos to become as strong as him one day. Side characters keep the fights interesting, as they all have vibrant and original personas and attacks, but Saitama is where most of the dramatic tension comes from.One Punch Man Volume 10 is the 3rd volume to feature the new main villain Garo, the human monster, and is easily one of my favorites in the series already. This volume doesn't feature any action scenes featuring any main characters, but still keeps up the same intense pacing of all the others. ONE manages to humanize even the main antagonist, and delivers powerful messages about what real strength entails without being hamfisted or cheesy. Yusuke Murata's art is as vibrant and lively as ever, even in simple black and white images.

No, instead it slowly pulls you in until it has you right where it wants you. And then, BAM! Twists and turns galore. While it’s not a book where you are flying through the pages at warp speed, you are still slowly and methodically pulled in to this fascinatingly concocted novel. Told from two different times; Then and Now, you know that Charlie is dead but you have no idea how she died. Was she murdered? Did she simply vanish? And why is Grace so overwhelmed with guilt?Grace thinks she may be going crazy. Or is she? She feels like someone is constantly watching her and she swears she keeps seeing a red car behind her. In her grief stricken state after the devastating loss of her best friend Charlie, Grace isn’t actually sure about anything. She is extremely innocent thinking and naïve, yet I still found myself caring about her. There is a vulnerability and tenderness surrounding Grace that tugged at my heart strings. She has very childlike qualities, especially  in the scenes with her absolutely precious grandparents. Her boyfriend Dan, while so annoying to me, was very protective of Grace and I can see why. She has that air about her, as if she’s always a bit of a damsel in distress, moments away from needing to be saved.Lexie is Charlie’s train wreck of a mother. My god how I loathed this woman throughout many parts of this book. She’s a cruel drunk, but although there were relatively few times I felt sympathy towards her, I admit I did. Her life hasn’t been easy. Then there is Anna, Charlie’s long lost sister. From the minute she was introduced she gave me a single white female vibe. I mentioned Dan earlier, and I really wanted to like him. I can’t. I don’t wanna say much more about these characters as it would spoil the plot twists, however if you’re anything like me you won’t trust any of them for a second.The suspense in this book is a slow build up and I was playing guessing games the entire time that Grace’s life was torn apart and ruined. I made many incorrect guess along the way but that thrills me! Quite proud of myself for having things all figured out, then whoops totally wrong. Onto the next theory.If you like an intense psychological thriller, give this book a try. A few times over the past couple of days while reading this I had to look over my own shoulder to make sure I was not being watched.

Now I am an adult and find Lifetime movies very paint by the numbers and basic.  The Sister is a Lifetime movie come to you via Kindle. The author has a writing style but unfortunately this book lacks originality along with a protagonist to root for. Everything that happens in this book you will see coming from a mile away there are no twists which is what compelled me to buy the book in the first place and there certainly are no thrills....unless finishing the book counts as a thrill.  Can we talk about the main character, Grace? The story begins with her reminiscing over her beloved best friend who has died and her trying to figure out the &#34;mystery&#34; her friend left behind. Sounds ok. However chapter after chapter is this Grace character moping over Charlie her best friend and she literally seems unable to function to the point that you wonder if they were lovers. It's extreme attachment issues or something. At some point you get sick of hearing about Charlie but you shouldnt because if she isnt thinking about Charlie she is anxious, tired, moody, scared and let's not forget sick....the character vomits about 800 times in this book! Of course I'm exaggerating, but only slightly. This miserable person, (Grave)despite her melancholy seems to be loved by everyone yet manages to always feel sorry for herself. I was tired of her by half of the book.  I continued on hoping to be thrilled but thrills never came. Near the end of the book I just couldn't stop rolling my eyes.

Grace connects with a young woman claiming to be Charlie's sister, but not everything is as it seems. Weird accidents begin happening and there's some weird events in both Grace and Charlie's past. The book switches between that past (chapters marked &#34;Then&#34;) and the present (&#34;Now&#34;), slowly revealing the story of the young women's tragic lives.I don't want to give away too much, but i will say that the book's main mystery is not the &#34;who,&#34; it's the &#34;why.&#34; And it's a great, twisted story.As much as I loved the book, it took a couple of chapters to get into it. But stick with it, it's worth it. Also, be prepared for lots of British slang.There's also some open-ended plot threads at the end that I'm hoping the author follows up on.

Review.create({ title: "A human eperience", rating: 5, body: "You are either going to love it or you're going to hate it.I read many reviews before deciding to purchase this book by  Many people said that it was clich&eacute; and it had already been done. Also a lot of other people said that the poems were too simplistic with not a lot of theme behind them.However I have never come across a book like this. I loved how it was split into four sections. Those four sections are titled The hurting, the loving, the breaking, the healing. And many ways I do see how people say that this is simplistic. But these themes basically come down to the human experience. Who has not hurt? Especially from childhood experiences that we may or may not realize molded who we are. Who has not loved? Who has not been hurt by that loving? And if you can get to it there is a healing process.I personally can relate to this book on so many different levels. I can relate to it based on family experiences, friendship's, intimate partners, and work associates.In a way and made me feel like rupi kaur was able to not bury these feelings like I have done for so long but actually put them into words and illustrations. I think that takes courage and probably a great amount of sacrifice. I only wish I could do something as simplistic as this that has so much meaning.Yes, it is a book of poems split into four sections. But those poems interweave and tell a story. What I really like about it is that you can kind of assume it's a memoir but you don't really know the true facts. It's almost like you have to fill it in for yourself. This is what I loved most about it because I could do that with my own experiences.It is not an expensive book and I was able to read it within one hour, and go back to it multiple times especially the section on the healing. It may be simple and not as sophisticated as intellectuals would like poetry to be however it made in effect on me and I do think it is worth reading.Can you give up one hour of your life to read this book with an open mind and realize how emotions and experiences truly shape who we are?I encourage you to read this book with an open mind and even purchase it for friends that you know are either struggling loving hurting or healing. And isn't that everyone? Can't you see how everyone is experiencing one of these things right now?It hit me so deeply that it is actually helping me on my own healing knowing that I am not alone. And that is ONE of the greatest human sufferings-loneliness. whenever I feel lonely I picked up this book and read it to remind myself that there are others out there suffering much more than I am and it gives me a great sense of gratitude.", user_id: user8.id, book_id: book102.id })

Review.create({ title: "True Story", rating: 4, body: "The first thing you should know, if you happen to be a Star Wars fan and are expecting a tale of romance between Han Solo and Princess Leia, you will be disappointed.  This is a rather unromantic account of a 3 month affair between two co-stars who were attracted to each other: one a stoic, complicated, reserved married father of 2 just starting to realize his dreams of making it big, and the other, a vivacious, emotionally inexperienced 19 year old woman with a big personality wanting to start her life as an adult.  Trouble is, she doesn't know how to handle it.  And his way of handling it is to be unemotional and silent.************The Following May Contain Details***************************************************The first part of the book is written in Carrie's chatty, charming, self-depreciating style as she tells of her early life working as a backup singer in her mother's variety show.  Father is absent, having left mother for Elizabeth Taylor (and Carrie manages to throw a few zinger his way as well.)  She takes us through the auditions for both Star Wars and the movie Carrie right up through how she chose that cinnamon bun hairstyle.  As for as a behind-the-scenes look at the movie, that's about it.  The rest is her account as that vulnerable 19 year old with the witty mouth who exudes faked confidence, who decided that she was going to have an affair on the movie set.  No married men, thank you very much, especially that intense, quiet, but gorgeous co-star.  Not like he'd ever go for someone like her, anyway, right?  All too soon, she's left wondering at what the gorgeous stranger in her bed is doing with the likes of her.  And so ensues a 3 month secret affair conducted during the weekends, between two people who are at very different places in their lives..There are no explicit details, just a couple of conversations..  (No, she never critiques his technique as a lover..)  And you don't get his side of the story, of course, because this is based on her own recollections and some diaries she found when renovating her bedroom.  The diary section is raw and painful and messy and sad and wounded as one might expect a young woman's recollections to be over a doomed affair.  She writes many poems, songs, and prose on her feelings of the situation and does not hold back.  Around him, she finds herself self-conscious and nervous.  She laments that they have no feeling for each other, that he should have stayed a stranger, that he's unemotional, silent, the MarlboroMan, boring, two-dimentional, quiet, and she's falling in love and falling apart.  She has already established that she's insecure (most people I know are insecure - me included) and young (rather unworldly and a bit naive as 19 year olds tend to be), so mix that with a grown man who is emotionally unavailable, and this is what you get.Side Commentary:Did he know she felt this way, or did he not?  Hard to say because neither of them were talking about their feelings with each other, but if he did I would imagine he did not want to encourage her, as he was married and had a family, and knew where this would lead.  Given the fact that this lasted 3 months, I can't imagine he had no feelings about it, even if he didn't show them (it's a well-known and often told fact that Harrison took drama classes in college to overcome his shyness.  Or maybe he's introverted.  Or maybe he's just a guy.  Who knows?)  Maybe he felt guilty, not just for cheating, not just for his wife, but for Carrie as well, for embarking on a 'casual' affair that turned out to not be so 'casual' afterall.  Something done in theory is always different in fact.And another thing:The stuff Carrie writes in her journal reads like an exposed nerve, but it's the stuff she's thinking and feeling - the angsty kind of stuff you write in a diary - not the stuff you share with a guy, especially one who's married (so maybe he didn't know, but I'm still betting he did.)  I'm sure most of you know that this is how women are - if you pass us in the hall at school and say 'hi', we're already wondering if this is the story we'll tell at our engagement party, of how we first met.  We get melodramatic;  It's just what we do.It did not end badly - it just ended (with a bit of relief and no regret.)The last part of the book fast-forwards 40 years.  She writes that she knows Harrison better now and he still leaves her tongue-tied.  If she was not proud of herself for having an affair with a married man (as she writes), I can only imagine he was not proud of himself either. (Also, she mentions that he is not a womanizer, and as far as she knows, she was his only affair and he was faithful to his other wives.)  And they've never mentioned it since.  Until now.So why tell this story at all?  Well, Carrie found those diaries and began reading them, remembering that time in her life fondly, even gratefully.  As we get older, remembering a time in our lives when everything was in front of us, when we were young and relevent and everything is new, becomes important (she writes this in different words.)  And she loves being Princess Leia, and is proud of it.  She says and writes that she has no desire to embarrass Harrison or hurt anyone with this old story, and she did call him and talk with him about it.  He didn't object or ask her to change anything.  This did not happen yesterday - it happened 40 years ago.  To read the diaries of the naive girl you were at 19 from the perspective of an older, wiser 60 year old is surreal.  I keep diaries, too, and, while I've never had an affair with Harrison Ford (darn!  and I'm not near 60 yet), I'm still shocked at the angst and drama of my former self, and what a particular situation meant to me and how it's shaped me.  This is something Carrie wanted to share because she found those diaries and it's a part of the history of that time in their lives, and because and she can look back on it now in a different way (time has a way of taking the sting out of such things.).And it's important to note that this is from her point of view as a 19 year old girl/woman - not now, who didn't understand that there are no such things as 'no-strings-attached' affairs.  I'm betting Harrison learned that too.", user_id: user1.id, book_id: book103.id })

When Caesar, a recent arrival from Virginia, tells her about the Underground Railroad, they decide to take a terrifying risk and escape.

Review.create({ title: "Too fictionalized for my tastes; no emotional connection to characters.  Lackluster.", rating: 3, body: "This book has gotten quite the boost on social media especially with Oprah touting it as her latest book club read.  Even though Oprah and I have had a tempestuous (albeit one-sided) bookish relationship in the past I thought I'd give this book a try because the slavery era in the US is one of my favorite eras to read about.  It showcases the dichotomy of the indomitable spirit and resilience of human beings despite the most horrific, vile and degrading actions that one person can inflict upon another.Even with all the hype and Oprah's seal of approval I wasn't a fan of this book. There was a lot of good description of the era, some emotional scenes of abuse which are vividly detailed and many diverse characters but it lacked a complexity to the plot and an emotional connection to the characters. Cora, and especially Caesar, felt underdeveloped with their inner feelings muffled to the reader. I also found the flow of the plot to be choppy as readers are repeatedly taken from the main plot into subplots and there were vast sections, mainly towards the end, where the plot would lag and my interest faltered.But my biggest beef has to be the author's fictionalized idea of the Underground Railroad. He described it as an actual subterranean railroad which brought slaves to freedom.  I realize that his concept of the real Underground Railroad was stated on the cover and that it's a historical FICTION read.  But this subway of sorts is too far fetched and I feel that the author took too many liberties moving the book into the historical fantasy genre. My first issue is that it confuses people who already know about the Underground Railroad (I had to reread several sections when it was first introduced because I thought I had misunderstood his intent).  There was no actual railroad with tracks, engines and conductors.  Instead it was a vast, intricate network of people who risked their own lives to hide and help slaves escape to the north, many of which came here to Canada.  I've recently seen people posting pictures online of underground rail tracks in relation to this book.  Now I'm concerned that people who didn't know much about the actual Underground Railroad will now mistakenly think there was a train to carry people who were fleeing torture and death at the hands of the people who claimed that they owned them. I don't think that addition to this story does the real underground railroad justice.There were a few things that I did enjoy about this book.  It details a different side to the era for me, specifically how former slaves were treated in the northern states and some of the racism that was still running rampant.  It was sad how the white population viewed and treated former slaves and their fear that this growing group would gain in power resulting in some white people proposing sterilization of the black populace.  This was all new information to me.For someone like me who has read a lot about this era I felt this book was lacking in a few areas.  I tried not to compare it to books like Roots by Alex Haley (my favourite book), The Kitchen House and Glory Over Everything by Kathleen Grissom and The Book of Negroes by Lawrence Hill (all stellar books) but, honestly, how can you not?I feel like I'm supposed to wax poetic about this book and shout my love for it from the rooftops.  Everyone and their brother adores it but it just didn't do it for me. While it had great intentions this book didn't live up to the hype nor the vivid and engrossing books about slavery and the underground railroad that have come before it.", user_id: user1.id, book_id: book104.id })
Review.create({ title: "A STORY THAT WILL HAUNT READERS FOR A LONG TIME!", rating: 5, body: "Colson Whitehead is no stranger to many readers as he has authored several widely acclaimed books since he made his debut with The Intuitionist in 1999. His latest work, The Underground Railroad which is sharp and ingenious, follows the harrowing plight of Cora who was a young slave on the Randall estate in Georgia. Set around the year 1812, Cora’s story is all the more heart-wrenching as her mother fled the cotton plantation leaving her behind, to fend for herself. What could have prompted Cora’s mother to leave her behind is in the realm of speculation. She was never found and successfully dodged the tracker who was assigned to track her down.While it is easy to jump to conclusions and label her as someone shorn of love and affection for Cora, reading about the immense difficulties faced by the slaves on the plantation tempered one’s judgemental attitude. It was beyond brutal – the ugly face of inhumanity laid bare. The slaves are subjected to all kinds of cruel and inhumane treatment – they are whipped, thrashed and raped at the slightest pretext and excuse. And in some instances, just for pure enjoyment and amusement. Public execution was reserved as the harshest punishment, but to many living without dignity and honor was far worse than public execution.The arrival of a new slave, Caesar, brought hope for Cora but it was a daunting one. Author Colson Whitehead masterfully narrated their story and painted a horrific picture of slavery during the period. The character of Cora was well fleshed, and would be hard to forget. The story was well conceived and the secondary characters, especially Caesar, helped to make a solid read. All in all, this is a compelling book which will enable many readers to revisit the past though the manner in which Cora escaped was a bit farfetched. But The Underground Railroad by Colson Whitehead is a book that will haunt many readers for a long time to come.", user_id: user2.id, book_id: book104.id })

So I was incredibly excited for the new one. I keep wondering if there's a therapy group where all the disgruntled fans can congragate and weep together. I'm also refusing to consider in cannon as it was not JKR herself who penned.  What they did to the INTEGRITY of these characters. I'm sick over it.  The entire 7 book series was about friendship, love and loyalty, and Harry knew that; and most importantly, knew that's what made him different from V. You're telling me, he, Ron and Herm  didn't continue to live and instil those values in their children? Rose was a bully, who was prejudice against someone without knowing them first.  Harry would never said he wished his kid wasn't his, or sacrificed his kid's only friendship over gosip. Harry wouldn't have choosen work over time with his family, which after all he'd been through WAS ALL HE EVER WANTED.If someone were to ask me, what is your favorite thing about Harry Potter?, I would hands down reply: Harry Potter's moral integrity, that is the heart of the series. It's his choosing to sacrifice himself for what is good. It's choosing friendship over suspicion. It's a defiant effort to turn towards the pain of loving and losing, then choosing not to love at all. It's choosing to do what right, and best for others even when it hurts, is inconvenient, or scary. It's fighting for truth and justice, even when you're the only one doing it.  And when you move away from those central themes, the integrity of who we know Harry (and friends) to have PROVEN himself to be, you destroy Harry Potter and all that he stood for for 7 books.  This new book is the worst kind of trash, the one that destroys the soul of our hero.Also, what they did to calm, measured, quirky, wise Dumbledore, making him a weepy, rude mess, who spoke in cliches, issuing a completely unnecessary &#34;apology&#34; to why Harry was at the Dursleys, when Dumbledore had already apologized profusely for that in HP5 AND severely told off the Dursleys in HP6 for their abusive behavior!

I grew up with Harry, I went to midnight premiers of the books and movies. I was so excited for this play. I wanted to like it. I really really did. If you are a fan I would say read it and form your own opinion. Here is what I thought:-  Where was George?-  Where was Teddy? Because he was in the station in th epilogue.-  Where was Hugo? You know the other child Ron and Hermione have.-  Lily and James Potter… MIA for most of the play. Like James? Was he even in it?-  Why was Ron running the joke shop? He is an Auror. WHAT HAPPENED TO GEORGE? WHY WASN’T HE RUNNING THE SHOP?!-  Let’s talk about Ron. Why was he so non-Ron like? His character, all jokes no supporting and listening to Harry and Hermione. Also he is hardly in the play.-  Harry’s relationship with Albus. Everything about this is upsetting.o  In the last book when they are dropping off the children at the Hogwarts express, the kids are genuinely confused as to why everyone is looking at them and Ron makes a joke saying “I’m famous”. It is deduced that the kids do not know the extent of everything their parents went through to save the world. Yet Albus feel the weight of his dad’s legacy. Huh.o  Then we have Harry SEPARATING Albus and Scorpious. Let’s go back to that epilogue where they all see Draco with his family and a joke gets made about not playing with his son. Which then Hermione corrects and Ron says to beat him on test but not to get too cozy and marry him. Again, making it seem that everything in the past is in the past. Then there is Harry’s history of friends at Hogwarts. He knows. He would not separate his son from his ONLY friend.-  Albus choosing Slytherin for a friend? Awesome.-  The rumors of Voldemort having a child and that not being stopped by the ministry? Stupid. The ministry would have stopped panic about an heir being possible. Also Voldemort was conceived without love. He never cared about having an heir because he wanted to be in power. An heir would have been competition for him.-  More on that point. Bellatrix pregnant. She would have loved to mother the Dark Lords child; there would have been no greater honor. But. This does not work with the original time line. Bella is never pregnant, she fights at the battle. And then the gang goes to Malfoy manor there is no baby in sight. And if. IF. Voldemort would have wanted an heir; wouldn’t he have made it a horcrux and offered it more protection?-  Sexual tension between Scorpious and Albus. Yet Albus has a crush on Delphi and Scorpious on Lily. I feel as though either they should have been opened about their romantic feels towards each other or this should have not been included.-  The flashbacks/dreams Harry has. When Dudley is mentioned (yay!) and you find out petunia is dead. I know she was horrible but I do think Harry would have deep feelings about his mother’s sister passing. I liked the blanket part.-  Bellatrix husband somehow got out of Azkaban and raised Delphi. How did he escape Azkaban? Because there is no way he got pardoned. So how did he escape? And after escaping how was there no alarm over him escaping. Sirius Black escapes and the freaking muggle minister is alerted! Then there is a massive breakout and it is all over the daily prophet. But hey, this guy who tortured the Longbottoms into insanity he escapes and it’s cool. Yeah, sounds legit.-  The new prophecy. First of all: how did it happen with no one knowing about it except Delphi. Who made it? It’s sounding more and more as if this witch convinced herself that she is the heir of the dark lord.-  Cedric. Cedric a character who was noble and good and died oh so tragically. This character who was loyal and kind and helped Harry turns DARK SIDE?!?! BECAUSE HE LOSES THE CUP. WHAT?!?! CEDRIC A DEAD EATER HAHAHAHA NOPE NOT FUNNY. Thank you for turning a good character and completely changing him for the worse. Thank goodness you did not include Sirius Black in your play.-  On that same characters changing note. The trolley lady…. Hm. I will just leave it at that.-  Polyjuice potion. That s*** takes a month to make. I read the chamber of secrets. Many times. It takes an effing month. And you need a piece of the person you are changing into. But wait not, here I got some polyjuice potion here in my back pocket and I just happen to carry my dad and his best friends hairs at all times. So let’s change into them and break into the ministry.-  Btw that potion is not necessary because you can transfigure a HUMAN. Seven books and that never came out. Must be very dark magic.-  On the dark magic note. Harry duels Delphi (a eighteen year old) and she is stronger? Um. Do we not recall Harry being a teenager and he beat Voldemort.

So even though I knew it was just a play script that J.K didn't write but liked it enough to let them put her name on it, I had to read it for myself.There is no way this should be officially thought of as the 8th story. She ended 7 fine and this just completely ruins that epilogue, she should never have let this be considered part of the HP universe. I went into this with low expectations and I was still a little disappointed. The characters don't act like they would if this were written by J.K. or any normal fan that know and love them as much as a lot of us do. The story skips over a bunch of things-i get it, it's a play... But the first few years at Hogwarts in the beginning were just a waste. You get to see some of the characters you love but others that you assume will be in it are completely ignored. I mean, the story has Hogwarts in it, where is Neville? Where is Hagrid? You're left completely in the dark about what has happened to a lot of these characters, not even a mention of them if they are alive or dead. The story itself is a bit ridiculous and is completely predictable. I won't give any spoilers but the whole thing is just one person after another whining about their daddy issues.Read this if you are curious and make your own decisions, but for me I wish I hadn't. I re-read 1-7 ever year (at least once a year, if not 2-3 times) unfortunately this book will sit on my shelf and never be read again. :-(", user_id: user3.id, book_id: book105.id })

Also a lot of other people said that the poems were too simplistic with not a lot of theme behind them.However I have never come across a book like this. I loved how it was split into four sections. Those four sections are titled The hurting, the loving, the breaking, the healing. And many ways I do see how people say that this is simplistic. But these themes basically come down to the human experience. Who has not hurt? Especially from childhood experiences that we may or may not realize molded who we are. Who has not loved? Who has not been hurt by that loving? And if you can get to it there is a healing process.I personally can relate to this book on so many different levels. I can relate to it based on family experiences, friendship's, intimate partners, and work associates.In a way and made me feel like rupi kaur was able to not bury these feelings like I have done for so long but actually put them into words and illustrations. I think that takes courage and probably a great amount of sacrifice. I only wish I could do something as simplistic as this that has so much meaning.Yes, it is a book of poems split into four sections. But those poems interweave and tell a story. What I really like about it is that you can kind of assume it's a memoir but you don't really know the true facts. It's almost like you have to fill it in for yourself.

Review.create({ title: "Underwhelming", rating: 3, body: "I read--and reread--this poetry collection over the course of three days. I really, really wanted to like it. I'd heard many great things about it. I should also add that just three or four weeks ago, I read Salt and Nejma by Nayyirah Waheed and Bone by Yrsa Daley Ward. Kaur says that each of the collection's chapters deals with love, loss, trauma, abuse, healing and femininity. This is true, but, on the whole, I would say that the majority of the poems are about heartbreak and overcoming the death of a relationship. Kaur writes in the style of Waheed and Warsan Shire. Yet, Kaur's language lacks the sensuousness, voluptuousness, and potency of the aforementioned poets. I was deeply disappointed. There are some gems scattered throughout the work, but I found each of the four chapters underwhelming. I kept waiting for the incredible sense of emotion that fills me every time I read Waheed, Warsan, or Daley Ward. It never came. I think that Kaur will find her own voice and rhythm as she continues to write. Additionally, it would be completely unfair of me to fail to mention that this is a visual poetry collection. The best (and most original) aspect of Milk and Honey is that you can read the images in conjunction to and apart from the written language.If you are a huge fan of Waheed and Shire, I would recommend skipping this collection.

People call him &#8220;the bitter neighbor from hell.&#8221; But must Ove be bitter just because he doesn&#8217;t walk around with a smile plastered to his face all the time? Behind the cranky exterior there is a story and a sadness. So when one November morning a chatty young couple with two chatty young daughters move in next door and accidentally flatten Ove&#8217;s mailbox, it is the lead-in to a comical and heartwarming tale of unkempt cats, unexpected friendship, and the ancient art of backing up a U-Haul.

Others in my book club liked it better than I did, but nobody thought it was a page-turner.  It's an easy read, but the writing style was disappointing and elementary for me.  At times it has this kind of a rhythm (as an example)...Ove thought that was ridiculous. Ove couldn't understand why someone would do such thing. Ove thought youngsters should know better.  That was perhaps intentional by the author, but it was too redundant for me.  Another thing that my book club and I could not understand was why the main character was only 59.  His age is mentioned 3 times.  The entire story is about a retired old curmudgeon (and the word OLD is used several times for Ove such as the &#34;blond weed neighbor calling him a &#34;crazy old muppet&#34;) who has lived in his house with his wife for 40 years and he just wants to die because his wife has already died.  He acts like an 90 year the whole book.  He doesn't know what a laptop, Ipad or Macbook is, cannot pronounce internet, thinks high heels and makeup are ridiculous, he drives slow, uses a shoehorn, doesn't know about hybrid cars, disagrees with using credit cards for shopping, doesn't use a coffee maker because a percolator is perfectly fine, etc.  I'm sorry but age 59 just doesn't fit the story.  His coworkers say, &#34;wouldn't it be nice to slow down&#34; because they are trying to &#34;retire the older generation.&#34;  I liked his neighbors as endearing characters, but the story is predictable and at times hard to believe.

Review.create({ title: "An amazing feel-good story", rating: 5, body: "This is a gem of a feel-good debut novel about A MAN CALLED OVE by Swedish author and blogger Fredrik Backman. It will make you laugh and make you cry and you will remember Ove for a long time.Some would call Ove a curmudgeon, a lovely word meaning a bad-tempered, difficult, cantankerous person. His wife called him the most inflexible man in the world - he borders on being obsessive compulsive but is generally a grumpy man who doesn't tolerate fools and likes things to be done that way he wants them. While many think that he is  just a rude and grumpy man, at heart you will find out that he is one of the kindest persons you will ever know.Ove is a 59 years old widower who has just been arbitrarily retired after 30 years in the same job. His world now revolves around his home and neighbourhood housing complex where he rules the roost making sure that all local rules and regulations are followed. He is very lonely since his wife died, he quarrelled with his best friend and neighbour years ago and rarely has contact with his neighbours.Ove's world is one of anger and sadness. One day a new neighbour accidentally flattens Ove's mailbox driving in an area where vehicles are prohibited. This starts a very amusing, heartwarming and frequently very sad story as Ove's rigidly structured world is disrupted by unexpected friendship from Parvaneh, a vivacious small and very pregnant Iranian woman who has moved in next door with her Swedish husband Patrick and two girls. Parvaneh is perhaps the only person who can take on Ove directly and win, and starts to change his life for the better.We also go back to how Ove met his vivacious and loving wife Sonja who was the direct opposite of Ove.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user2.id, book_id: book107.id })

He complains about everything, has put up signs around his neighborhood with rules about what should and shouldn't be done, and feels there is a proper place for everything. He is not a friendly guy to say the least.Into his life walks or rather drives a family who are to be his new neighbors. He doesn't bother to get to know their names and calls them the pregnant one and the lanky one. After an accident with the lanky one, Ove is forced to help this family, complaining the entire time.Throughout the book Ove also speaks to his wife, complaining about the neighbors, the rule breakers, and how much he misses her (very minor spoiler). During interludes within the narrative, we read about how Ove became Ove. I will say by the end of the book, a bunch of dust was flying around the room and some got into my eyes.The first thing to write is this book is funny. Ove is quite the character and how he treats people is hysterical. He just doesn't care what he says or how he says it. He simply wants order in his world and has lived that way for all of his life. The way he expresses himself becomes incredibly funny.It is also a tragic story. Backman interweaves the two (funny and tragic) quite well and doesn't make it overly heartwarming.

Elias finds himself a bit perturbed; Chise is starting to make friends, a situation that he finds discomforting.  She does what amounts to a girls' day out with Alice, the alchemist Renfred's apprentice.  She learns Alice's story, which is an unsettling but hopeful one.  Then, around Christmas, Chise and Elias encounter Stella, a girl visiting the town who is trying to find her brother, who somehow got lost when they were playing.  It gets stranger when her parents tell her she's an only child and never had a brother.  What follows is a fine tale about the potentially high cost of saying nasty things to your relatives.  Certain supernatural entities just might take you too literally.  We also get to learn more about Hazel, the centaur delivery person, who's been a cameo figure up to now, but proves most engaging. This volume comes with a bonus booklet with a nice little story about Chise and Elias having a talk about things that scare them.

Review.create({ title: "A human eperience", rating: 5, body: "You are either going to love it or you're going to hate it.I read many reviews before deciding to purchase this book by  Many people said that it was clich&eacute; and it had already been done. Also a lot of other people said that the poems were too simplistic with not a lot of theme behind them.However I have never come across a book like this. I loved how it was split into four sections. Those four sections are titled The hurting, the loving, the breaking, the healing. And many ways I do see how people say that this is simplistic. But these themes basically come down to the human experience. Who has not hurt? Especially from childhood experiences that we may or may not realize molded who we are. Who has not loved? Who has not been hurt by that loving? And if you can get to it there is a healing process.I personally can relate to this book on so many different levels. I can relate to it based on family experiences, friendship's, intimate partners, and work associates.In a way and made me feel like rupi kaur was able to not bury these feelings like I have done for so long but actually put them into words and illustrations. I think that takes courage and probably a great amount of sacrifice. I only wish I could do something as simplistic as this that has so much meaning.Yes, it is a book of poems split into four sections. But those poems interweave and tell a story. What I really like about it is that you can kind of assume it's a memoir but you don't really know the true facts. It's almost like you have to fill it in for yourself.

Review.create({ title: "Underwhelming", rating: 3, body: "I read--and reread--this poetry collection over the course of three days. I really, really wanted to like it. I'd heard many great things about it. I should also add that just three or four weeks ago, I read Salt and Nejma by Nayyirah Waheed and Bone by Yrsa Daley Ward. Kaur says that each of the collection's chapters deals with love, loss, trauma, abuse, healing and femininity. This is true, but, on the whole, I would say that the majority of the poems are about heartbreak and overcoming the death of a relationship. Kaur writes in the style of Waheed and Warsan Shire. Yet, Kaur's language lacks the sensuousness, voluptuousness, and potency of the aforementioned poets. I was deeply disappointed. There are some gems scattered throughout the work, but I found each of the four chapters underwhelming. I kept waiting for the incredible sense of emotion that fills me every time I read Waheed, Warsan, or Daley Ward. It never came. I think that Kaur will find her own voice and rhythm as she continues to write. Additionally, it would be completely unfair of me to fail to mention that this is a visual poetry collection. The best (and most original) aspect of Milk and Honey is that you can read the images in conjunction to and apart from the written language.If you are a huge fan of Waheed and Shire, I would recommend skipping this collection.
