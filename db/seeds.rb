Natasha Leonova&rsquo;s beauty saved her life. Discovered on a freezing Moscow street by a Russian billionaire, she has lived for seven years under his protection, immersed in rarefied luxury, while he pursues his activities in a dark world that she guesses at but never sees. Her home is the world, often on one of Vladimir Stanislas&rsquo;s spectacular yachts manned by scores of heavily armed crew members. Natasha&rsquo;s job is to keep Vladimir happy, ask no questions, and be discreet. She knows her place, and the rules. She feels fortunate to be spoiled and protected, and is careful not to dwell on Vladimir&rsquo;s ruthlessness or the deadly circles he moves in. She experiences only his kindness and generosity and believes he will always keep her safe. She is unfailingly loyal to him in exchange. Theo Luca is the son of a brilliant, world famous, and difficult artist, Lorenzo Luca, who left his wife and son with a fortune in artwork they refuse to sell. Lorenzo&rsquo;s widow, Maylis, has transformed their home in St. Paul de Vence into a celebrated restaurant decorated with her late husband&rsquo;s paintings, and treats it as a museum. There, on a warm June evening, Theo first encounters Natasha, the most exquisite woman he has ever seen. And there, Vladimir lays eyes on Luca&rsquo;s artwork. Two dangerous obsessions begin. Theo, a gifted artist in his own right, finds himself feverishly painting Natasha&rsquo;s image for weeks after their first meeting. Vladimir, enraged that Lorenzo&rsquo;s works are not for sale, is determined to secure a painting at any price. And Natasha, who knows that she cannot afford to make even one false move, nevertheless begins to think of a world of freedom she can never experience as Vladimir&rsquo;s mistress. She cannot risk her safety for another man, or even a conversation with him, as Theo longs for a woman he can never have.  From Moscow to the Riviera, Paris, and London, The Mistress is a riveting tale of vast fortune, cruelty, creative genius, and daring courage, as uncompromising individuals chart a course for collision.", amazon_link: "https://www.amazon.com/Mistress-Novel-Danielle-Steel/dp/0345531116", kobo_link: "https://www.kobo.com/us/en/ebook/property-of-a-noblewoman", play_link: "https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Danielle_Steel_Magic?id=pj3ZCgAAQBAJ" })

Despite wading through run-on sentences and mind-numbing repetition, I can pass the time by reading an uncomplicated, often formulaic, tale while surrounded by typical airport hubbub.The Mistress is a new low for Ms. Steele. I found myself re-reading complete paragraphs previously encountered earlier in the book. Even more peculiar were incidents described in minute detail before they had even occurred in the chronology.My only conclusion is that Danielle Steele overused the copy/cut and paste feature of her word processor. I envisioned her using a collection of paragraphs much like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. Her problem was that the pieces did not quite fit together.At the hefty price tag for this book, she and her publisher are insulting her readers. The story itself is mundane and uninteresting. She could have told it in a novella. After slogging through chapter after chapter, I finally reached the unsatisfactory conclusion.Assigning a book only one star is rare for me.

He is living the dream, and his marriage to the bewitching Vivian is the center of that.

And I hate to put this negative energy out there because I have read every book, and I do mean every book that Nicholas Sparks has ever written, but I just really disliked this book.It started off in fairly decent fashion, but like some of the other reviews, I found the book dragging on. I understand when you are unhappy in a relationship that your life becomes one big let down.. but I felt the book was like this too. It just had so much negativity for how terrible his marriage was that it made it hard to read. We all read for entertainment or to pass the time... but the book was hard to get through. One thing I will say is that like another review stated, I too disliked the characteristics of the character of Russ. He was spineless at times and I found myself screaming at the book about how he shouldn't let Vivian walk all over him. I wish that there would have been more focus on the development of Emily and his love rather than the let down of his marriage. It badly needed a silver lining. However in true Sparks fashion I did cry at the end of the book and it did evoke emotion within me. But I will say that I will not be re-reading this one. I often find myself re-reading his other works and will continue to do so.... but I would say that this was the worst of the books he has written thus far. I wanted to love this book... but I just had trouble even finishing it. I would agree I too noticed editing errors. I wondered how rushed the book had been to complete.Keep trying Mr. Sparks... I want to restore my faith in your amazing and well written writing. You are and always will be one of my favorite authors and as a girl from your home state of Nebraska... I will always continue to root for you. But I wouldn't call this one of your best pieces sadly.", user_id: user4.id, book_id: book2.id })

I could not have been more wrong, but I almost wish Mr. Sparks would go back to his old clich&eacute;.Instead the book comes off more like a Taylor Swift break-up song she writes for the sole purpose of revenge.  At first Russ and Vivian are a happy newlywed couple.  Very quickly their daughter London comes along and they settle into a typical middle class life with her staying home and him going off to his fancy PR job.  But when he feels insecure at work he quits his job and starts his own company without getting a single client ready first. He then becomes bitter and feels insecure.  Vivian gets a job with Walter Spannerman (read that as Donald Trump) and Russ is resentful.  The next 7 chapters are from his point of view as he complains because he has to spend time with his daughter, taking her to her activities and doing household chores like grocery shopping, cooking, cleaning, and laundry.  As if that is not enough he grumbles because he is not getting enough attention in the bedroom. When the couple does spend time together they bicker and snipe at each other constantly.  While reading it I start feeling agitated and cranky too.If all that is not enough the book is poorly edited.

It is a story of love, hurt, family, courage and healing. It is a story that will make you laugh and cry with the narrator, advertising executive Russell Green, who hadn&#8217;t given much thought about having a child when his wife Vivian broke the news. When London was born, Vivian quits her job to be a stay-at-home mom. When Russell quits his job to start his own business, Vivian decides to return to work, slowly but surely letting them drift apart. With his wife working, Russell took charge of London, showering her with his attention, affection and love. When the inevitable happened in his marriage, though not unexpected, Russell was shattered.Nicholas Sparks&#8217; Two by Two is a poignant though not an out of this world story. It is a story that is regrettably becoming a familiarity, at least some parts of it. Four different women played important roles in shaping Russell Green. Vivian, Emily, Marge and London. Vivian gave him a daughter, Marge stood by him to weather the storms during his most difficult days, Emily&#8217;s appearance almost seemed preordained and London, she was his everything. But to each of them he was a different person. He was a husband to Vivian, a brother to Marge, a suitor to Emily and a father to London. Through these characters and their stories, Nicholas Sparks explored the strength and frailty of human relationship, and the ties that bind two people together.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user13.id, book_id: book2.id })

If there is such a thing, I would call this a boring page-turner. You keep turning the pages expecting it to get better but then you get to the end and realize---that was it.  I mean it has all the nuts and bolts of a solidly written piece of fiction but there is just no spark to it, nothing clever or surprising. After I'd turned all the pages, I blinked several times and turned off my kindle - surprised that it was over because it never quite got off the ground.  The characters are one-dimensional and there is no real connection to them. Like the heroine in Gray Mountain, the female lead in this book is totally vanilla. You're not rooting for her or against her as there is little depth or character development.* some spoilersThe plot is laid out early in the book - there is a corrupt judge colluding with some thugs to skim money at an Indian casino. To expose the corruption, there are a few individuals trying to blow the whistle on the judge to collect cash under the whistle-blower statutes. The whistle-blowers submit a complaint to the agency that investigates rogue judges and an investigation begins. These facts are known early on.  The problem is - that's the entire plot. There are no twists or turns it goes in a fairly straight line from corruption complaint to indictments with few surprises along the way.  There is also a huge loose end as we never find out what happens to one of the characters who was falsely imprisoned for murders he did not commit. Since this character is a main focus in the prequel, the failure to tie up that loose end is irritating.All in all - it is just an uneven effort.

When Caesar, a recent arrival from Virginia, tells her about the Underground Railroad, they decide to take a terrifying risk and escape.

Review.create({ title: "A STORY THAT WILL HAUNT READERS FOR A LONG TIME!", rating: 5, body: "Colson Whitehead is no stranger to many readers as he has authored several widely acclaimed books since he made his debut with The Intuitionist in 1999. His latest work, The Underground Railroad which is sharp and ingenious, follows the harrowing plight of Cora who was a young slave on the Randall estate in Georgia. Set around the year 1812, Cora&#8217;s story is all the more heart-wrenching as her mother fled the cotton plantation leaving her behind, to fend for herself. What could have prompted Cora&#8217;s mother to leave her behind is in the realm of speculation. She was never found and successfully dodged the tracker who was assigned to track her down.While it is easy to jump to conclusions and label her as someone shorn of love and affection for Cora, reading about the immense difficulties faced by the slaves on the plantation tempered one&#8217;s judgemental attitude. It was beyond brutal &#8211; the ugly face of inhumanity laid bare. The slaves are subjected to all kinds of cruel and inhumane treatment &#8211; they are whipped, thrashed and raped at the slightest pretext and excuse. And in some instances, just for pure enjoyment and amusement. Public execution was reserved as the harshest punishment, but to many living without dignity and honor was far worse than public execution.The arrival of a new slave, Caesar, brought hope for Cora but it was a daunting one. Author Colson Whitehead masterfully narrated their story and painted a horrific picture of slavery during the period. The character of Cora was well fleshed, and would be hard to forget. The story was well conceived and the secondary characters, especially Caesar, helped to make a solid read. All in all, this is a compelling book which will enable many readers to revisit the past though the manner in which Cora escaped was a bit farfetched.

It&#8217;s pretty hard to put down once you start reading. Whitehead uses metaphor and re-imagines the institution of slavery to convey powerful messages about what it actually means to be in bondage, the pain of being denied a legacy and culture and the complexity of expressing emotions and showing love in a world where your status is always at question. Whitehead uses his writing about the past to make creative connections to current day issues and challenges that we see today.While this book is not meant to teach about the inner workings of underground railroad or the actual differences in the institution of slavery in different states, you can learn to build empathy for the men, women, and children who experienced slavery. If you can&#8217;t do that because you feel like it is too fictional then you are cold-hearted.*Side-note* I am thoroughly confused by people who read this book hoping to learn more about slavery or the underground railroad.

It showcases the dichotomy of the indomitable spirit and resilience of human beings despite the most horrific, vile and degrading actions that one person can inflict upon another.Even with all the hype and Oprah's seal of approval I wasn't a fan of this book. There was a lot of good description of the era, some emotional scenes of abuse which are vividly detailed and many diverse characters but it lacked a complexity to the plot and an emotional connection to the characters. Cora, and especially Caesar, felt underdeveloped with their inner feelings muffled to the reader. I also found the flow of the plot to be choppy as readers are repeatedly taken from the main plot into subplots and there were vast sections, mainly towards the end, where the plot would lag and my interest faltered.But my biggest beef has to be the author's fictionalized idea of the Underground Railroad. He described it as an actual subterranean railroad which brought slaves to freedom.  I realize that his concept of the real Underground Railroad was stated on the cover and that it's a historical FICTION read.  But this subway of sorts is too far fetched and I feel that the author took too many liberties moving the book into the historical fantasy genre.

They demand swift action. Dr. Cross is asked to take the job as Chief of Detectives but turns it down. His wife, Bree Stone, accepts the position. This makes for interesting team and family dynamics as they pursue bad guys across the District. Interest grows as the story wades through several subplots. One involves a group of hardcore ex-military vigilantes who take the law into their own hands, another trudges into the manufacture and distribution of dangerous narcotics, and yet another deals with the trafficking and servitude of young European women at an exclusive Washington area resort.

True love and vast wisdom exude from those soulful eyes. Eyes that may have seen many lives.This is a novel of acceptance, loyalty,survival and greater than anything....true love that never ends.Scientific research has told us that a dog does not remember, that we humanize them to serve our own needs.

The author masterfully captures what many of us would imagine to be the thought processes of our dogs, and makes the reader think about the role we play in our pets' lives, for good and for bad.

Lest anyone think that this is yet another book in the growing dog channeling genre, rest assured that this book is much more than that.

He&#8217;s a curmudgeon&#8212;the kind of man who points at people he dislikes as if they were burglars caught outside his bedroom window. He has staunch principles, strict routines, and a short fuse. People call him &#8220;the bitter neighbor from hell.&#8221; But must Ove be bitter just because he doesn&#8217;t walk around with a smile plastered to his face all the time? Behind the cranky exterior there is a story and a sadness. So when one November morning a chatty young couple with two chatty young daughters move in next door and accidentally flatten Ove&#8217;s mailbox, it is the lead-in to a comical and heartwarming tale of unkempt cats, unexpected friendship, and the ancient art of backing up a U-Haul. All of which will change one cranky old man and a local residents&#8217; association to their very foundations.  A feel-good story in the spirit of The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry and Major Pettigrew&#8217;s Last Stand, Fredrik Backman&#8217;s novel about the angry old man next door is a thoughtful exploration of the profound impact one life has on countless others. &#8220;If there was an award for &#8216;Most Charming Book of the Year,&#8217; this first novel by a Swedish blogger-turned-overnight-sensation would win hands down&#8221; (Booklist, starred review).", amazon_link: "https://www.amazon.com/Man-Called-Ove-Novel/dp/1476738025", kobo_link: "https://www.kobo.com/us/en/search?query=A%20Man%20Called%20Ove:%20A%20Novel%20Fredrik%20Backman", play_link: "https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Fredrik_Backman_Un_hombre_llamado_Ove?id=EqdsAwAAQBAJ" })

Review.create({ title: "A Book for everyone", rating: 5, body: "There is a part of me that didn't think I needed to review A Man Called Ove because so many people have read it at this point, but I have talked to a few who have not, hence my desire to write this review.I will admit that I am entirely on the Ove train!The book is about a man, named Ove, who is the angry neighbor that we all seem to have. He complains about everything, has put up signs around his neighborhood with rules about what should and shouldn't be done, and feels there is a proper place for everything. He is not a friendly guy to say the least.Into his life walks or rather drives a family who are to be his new neighbors. He doesn't bother to get to know their names and calls them the pregnant one and the lanky one. After an accident with the lanky one, Ove is forced to help this family, complaining the entire time.Throughout the book Ove also speaks to his wife, complaining about the neighbors, the rule breakers, and how much he misses her (very minor spoiler). During interludes within the narrative, we read about how Ove became Ove. I will say by the end of the book, a bunch of dust was flying around the room and some got into my eyes.The first thing to write is this book is funny. Ove is quite the character and how he treats people is hysterical. He just doesn't care what he says or how he says it. He simply wants order in his world and has lived that way for all of his life. The way he expresses himself becomes incredibly funny.It is also a tragic story. Backman interweaves the two (funny and tragic) quite well and doesn't make it overly heartwarming. This could have easily become a book with the sentiment that we don't know people's past, so don't judge them, but it isn't. Ove is an ass in his past too and sometimes with reason. Backman keeps it level with just enough to make the reader fall for Ove.The great thing is this is a book that pretty much anyone and everyone can (and will) enjoy. I recommended this one for book clubs and discussion groups. Grandmas will like this as well as middle aged men. Ove is simply a good book.I gave this one 5 stars.", user_id: user2.id, book_id: book8.id })

This kind of transformation reminds me of another book I really enjoyed,&nbsp;Practical Enlightenment&nbsp;by Ariel & Shya Kane. The Kanes write about simple ideas that have transformed the way I relate and, as a result, my life feels easy and full of possibility.

I was born and raised in Finland, so I know something about the people described in this book and what makes them tick, or explode, for that matter.The story follows Ove, a curmudgeon and an introvert, who goes through his life in a non-descript housing development, following his own strict rules of proper and orderly behavior.  The writing is at times brilliant and at times tedious.  The plot plods along, often circling back to itself for totally unnecessary repetitions, which start feeling like annoying page fillers without purpose.  The endless discussions about car ownership, what kind of people drive Saabs vs. Volvos, and what are the pros and cons of each, are funny for the first time but extremely tedious when repeated ad nauseum.  And the same goes for the small supporting cast of characters.Why this book is so popular and well received is beyond me, but then again I didn't think much of the Norwegian bestseller &#34;My Struggle,&#34;  so maybe its just me.  The story is so predictable that after the first 20-30 pages I knew what was going to happen and how it was going to end.  There were some pleasant surprises sprinkled in, but they couldn't carry the story on their own.It is unfortunate that books like this are defining non-Scandinavians' view of what light-hearted and humoristic Scandinavian literature is all about, just like the endless and extremely graphic serial murderer mysteries have come to define Scandinavian crime mystery genre.  There is a wealth of much better constructed and written books being published in Scandinavia these days that are much better representatives of excellent Scandinavian/Nordic literature that don't have follow the moody, dark, hopeless storylines that have dominated Nordic literature in the past.A Man Named Ove is a good effort, but to me as a lover of Scandinavian literature it was definitely a disappointment.", user_id: user4.id, book_id: book8.id })

A touching perspective on loss and what it means to choose life and figure out one's new role as a loner.  It also celebrates the importance of coincidence and embracing what life brings.Laughed out loud and blubbered like a baby--what more can one ask of a book?

They've recently had a child which is something Rachel was unable to produce when she was married to him.  He's moved his new family into the home that he and Rachel once shared.

Review.create({ title: "ALCOHOLIC AMNESIA", rating: 4, body: "THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN is a dark, haunting and depressing psychological thriller, but it's incredibly effective thanks to the writing skills of author Paula Hawkins.  Rachel is a divorced woman who would do anything for a drink, and like a lot of folks consumed by a love affair with the bottle, one might call her a victim of circumstances.  Her husband Tom had an affair that resulted in a pregnancy.  He divorced Rachel, married the other woman and now all three (husband, wife and child) are happily ensconced in the house that was once Rachel's.The train that Rachel rides to London each day takes her past her old neighborhood.  From the window of the train she observes not only her old garden that backs up to the tracks, but also the daily activities of another couple who reside down the street from her previous home.  In her imagination she has given the couple names and has created a fairy tale love life for them. Real life, however, cannot live up to her fantasy and the couple does not have the picture perfect relationship that Rachel has concocted.  When a murder occurs, Rachel becomes entangled in the investigation because of what she has witnessed on her daily commute.This rather bleak story with intersecting timelines is told from the viewpoint of three different women Rachel, Anne and Megan.  All the women are unreliable narrators with something to hide.  In fact, most of the characters in this novel, including the men, lack veracity, and are a self-serving and unsympathetic group with plenty of skeletons in their closets.Lest I continue and divulge too much of the plot, let me just say that the twists and turns in the story are many and readers will be easily drawn in, making it easy to devour this book in one afternoon.", user_id: user7.id, book_id: book10.id })

Review.create({ title: "Baffled by Its Success", rating: 2, body: "I think I would ordinarily cut this book more of a break because it is fast-paced - Hawkins wastes zero time describing anything that doesn't have to do with exactly what is going on in the moment - and while that doesn't make her a great writer, there is absolutely nothing here that will transcend, or reverberate within you long after you've finished reading - it at least doesn't bog you down with preciousness. But because the book has received so many rave reviews - I have to judge it more harshly because it just isn't deserved. This is serviceable writing at best - about the level you'd read on Fiction Press - about the level you would get from a first year MFA student. If someone is digging around in something, they are 'scrabbling' (over and over). The lead character's blackouts are along the lines of: &#34;I couldn't remember. It was all dark. All black. All cloudy. Couldn't remember.&#34; I'm making that up, but it's not significantly different. So, that's the writing, let's get to the plot.The book is told from the POV of three different female characters, none of them compelling in the slightest. We're supposed to care deeply that a woman who chronically cheats on her husband disappears. I really didn't care that she did, frankly. Then we're supposed to care that Rachel, who drinks too much on the train while she pretends to commute to a job she doesn't have and obsesses about her ex-husband and her 'barren womb', may or may not have witnessed a crime. I didn't care about Rachel, didn't care about the woman who'd gone MIA. Now let's get to the third character you can't care about - Anna.

Although Coelho's attempt to convey changing one's life as an alchemist can change ordinary metal into gold is somewhat original, he drastically fails to make it anything more than a very briefly alluded to concept. Otherwise every other somewhat original idea he presents is too mystical and too irrational to even be accepted as truth, such as his ridiculous notion of a Personal Legend motivated by the Soul of the Universe. Rather than The Alchemist conveying any true wisdom, it feels as if it is Coelho's dumping ground of his underdeveloped musings on life.  Although he does attempt to provide a new insight into life with each new person Santiago meets, he should instead had each person teach Santiago a completely different lesson regarding different aspects of life. Then these lessons could have all merged to create something vaguely resembling an epiphany. Instead, Coelho tried to make every new companion relate to an overlying soul of the universe theory.

The decline of this group, a demographic of our country that has been slowly disintegrating over forty years, has been reported on with growing frequency and alarm, but has never before been written about as searingly from the inside. J. D. Vance tells the true story of what a social, regional, and class decline feels like when you were born with it hung around your neck.The Vance family story begins hopefully in postwar America. J. D.&#8217;s grandparents were &#8220;dirt poor and in love,&#8221; and moved north from Kentucky&#8217;s Appalachia region to Ohio in the hopes of escaping the dreadful poverty around them. They raised a middle-class family, and eventually their grandchild (the author) would graduate from Yale Law School, a conventional marker of their success in achieving generational upward mobility.But as the family saga of&#160;Hillbilly Elegy&#160;plays out, we learn that this is only the short, superficial version. Vance&#8217;s grandparents, aunt, uncle, sister, and, most of all, his mother, struggled profoundly with the demands of their new middle-class life, and were never able to fully escape the legacy of abuse, alcoholism, poverty, and trauma so characteristic of their part of America. Vance piercingly shows how he himself still carries around the demons of their chaotic family history.A deeply moving memoir with its share of humor and vividly colorful figures,&#160;Hillbilly Elegy&#160;is the story of how upward mobility really feels. And it is an urgent and troubling meditation on the loss of the American dream for a large segment of this country.", amazon_link: "https://www.amazon.com/Hillbilly-Elegy-Memoir-Family-Culture/dp/0062300547", kobo_link: "https://www.kobo.com/us/en/ebook/settle-for-more", play_link: "https://play.google.com/store/search?c=books&hl=en&q=Hillbilly%20Elegy:%20A%20Memoir%20of%20a%20Family%20and%20Culture%20in%20Crisis%20J.%20D.%20Vance" })

His family identified as being strongly Christian even though their behavior was frequently not particularly Christian.

He did poorly in school and was only redeemed by the fact that a cousin pushed him into joining the Marines. From there he went to Ohio State and then to Yale Law School.He writes very directly and honestly about the problems with white, working class America and why it is in decline. While part of the problem is societal, he believes there is an internal problem that government cannot do anything about. He suggests that tribalism, mistrust of outsiders and &#34;elites,&#34; violence and irresponsibility among family members, parents without ethics and a sense of responsibility, terrible work ethics, and an us-against-them mentality is dooming the people who live that way to becoming poorer, more addicted, and more marginalized.

It is a life on the very edge of plausibility, without the sense of extra-family community that serves as a stabilizing agent in many first-generation immigrant communities or communities of color. Drugs, crime, jail time, abusive interactions without any knowledge of other forms of interaction, children growing up in a wild mix of stoned mother care, foster care, and care by temporary &#34;boyfriends,&#34; and in general, an image of life on the edge of survival where even the heroes are distinctly flawed for lack of knowledge and experience of any other way of living.This is a story that many of the &#34;upwardly mobile middle class&#34; in the coastal areas, often so quick to judge the lifestyles and politics of &#34;those people&#34; in middle America, has no clue about. I speak from experience as someone that grew up in the heartland but has spent years in often elite circles on either coast.Two things struck me most about this book.First, the unflinching yet not judgmental portrayal of the circumstances and of the people involved. It is difficult to write on this subject without either glossing over the ugliness and making warm and fuzzy appeals to idealism and human nature, Hollywood style, or without on the other hand descending into attempts at political persuasion and calls to activism.

I agree with his conclusion that no government program will stop the continuing cycle of drugs, poverty, teen pregnancy, and the feeling of hopelessness these people have. The cycle repeats from generation to generation with no end in sight. Vance was the exception in finding a way out, largely through the love, guidance and encouragement of his grandmother. She also kept him away from the wrong kind of friends. Very few children in his situation are as lucky. But there also had to be something inside himself that helped him escape.

Review.create({ title: "True Story", rating: 4, body: "The first thing you should know, if you happen to be a Star Wars fan and are expecting a tale of romance between Han Solo and Princess Leia, you will be disappointed.  This is a rather unromantic account of a 3 month affair between two co-stars who were attracted to each other: one a stoic, complicated, reserved married father of 2 just starting to realize his dreams of making it big, and the other, a vivacious, emotionally inexperienced 19 year old woman with a big personality wanting to start her life as an adult.  Trouble is, she doesn't know how to handle it.  And his way of handling it is to be unemotional and silent.************The Following May Contain Details***************************************************The first part of the book is written in Carrie's chatty, charming, self-depreciating style as she tells of her early life working as a backup singer in her mother's variety show.  Father is absent, having left mother for Elizabeth Taylor (and Carrie manages to throw a few zinger his way as well.)  She takes us through the auditions for both Star Wars and the movie Carrie right up through how she chose that cinnamon bun hairstyle.  As for as a behind-the-scenes look at the movie, that's about it.  The rest is her account as that vulnerable 19 year old with the witty mouth who exudes faked confidence, who decided that she was going to have an affair on the movie set.  No married men, thank you very much, especially that intense, quiet, but gorgeous co-star.  Not like he'd ever go for someone like her, anyway, right?  All too soon, she's left wondering at what the gorgeous stranger in her bed is doing with the likes of her.  And so ensues a 3 month secret affair conducted during the weekends, between two people who are at very different places in their lives..There are no explicit details, just a couple of conversations..  (No, she never critiques his technique as a lover..)  And you don't get his side of the story, of course, because this is based on her own recollections and some diaries she found when renovating her bedroom.  The diary section is raw and painful and messy and sad and wounded as one might expect a young woman's recollections to be over a doomed affair.  She writes many poems, songs, and prose on her feelings of the situation and does not hold back.  Around him, she finds herself self-conscious and nervous.  She laments that they have no feeling for each other, that he should have stayed a stranger, that he's unemotional, silent, the MarlboroMan, boring, two-dimentional, quiet, and she's falling in love and falling apart.  She has already established that she's insecure (most people I know are insecure - me included) and young (rather unworldly and a bit naive as 19 year olds tend to be), so mix that with a grown man who is emotionally unavailable, and this is what you get.Side Commentary:Did he know she felt this way, or did he not?  Hard to say because neither of them were talking about their feelings with each other, but if he did I would imagine he did not want to encourage her, as he was married and had a family, and knew where this would lead.  Given the fact that this lasted 3 months, I can't imagine he had no feelings about it, even if he didn't show them (it's a well-known and often told fact that Harrison took drama classes in college to overcome his shyness.  Or maybe he's introverted.  Or maybe he's just a guy.  Who knows?)  Maybe he felt guilty, not just for cheating, not just for his wife, but for Carrie as well, for embarking on a 'casual' affair that turned out to not be so 'casual' afterall.  Something done in theory is always different in fact.And another thing:The stuff Carrie writes in her journal reads like an exposed nerve, but it's the stuff she's thinking and feeling - the angsty kind of stuff you write in a diary - not the stuff you share with a guy, especially one who's married (so maybe he didn't know, but I'm still betting he did.)  I'm sure most of you know that this is how women are - if you pass us in the hall at school and say 'hi', we're already wondering if this is the story we'll tell at our engagement party, of how we first met.  We get melodramatic;  It's just what we do.It did not end badly - it just ended (with a bit of relief and no regret.)The last part of the book fast-forwards 40 years.  She writes that she knows Harrison better now and he still leaves her tongue-tied.  If she was not proud of herself for having an affair with a married man (as she writes), I can only imagine he was not proud of himself either. (Also, she mentions that he is not a womanizer, and as far as she knows, she was his only affair and he was faithful to his other wives.)  And they've never mentioned it since.  Until now.So why tell this story at all?  Well, Carrie found those diaries and began reading them, remembering that time in her life fondly, even gratefully.  As we get older, remembering a time in our lives when everything was in front of us, when we were young and relevent and everything is new, becomes important (she writes this in different words.)  And she loves being Princess Leia, and is proud of it.  She says and writes that she has no desire to embarrass Harrison or hurt anyone with this old story, and she did call him and talk with him about it.  He didn't object or ask her to change anything.  This did not happen yesterday - it happened 40 years ago.  To read the diaries of the naive girl you were at 19 from the perspective of an older, wiser 60 year old is surreal.  I keep diaries, too, and, while I've never had an affair with Harrison Ford (darn!  and I'm not near 60 yet), I'm still shocked at the angst and drama of my former self, and what a particular situation meant to me and how it's shaped me.  This is something Carrie wanted to share because she found those diaries and it's a part of the history of that time in their lives, and because and she can look back on it now in a different way (time has a way of taking the sting out of such things.).And it's important to note that this is from her point of view as a 19 year old girl/woman - not now, who didn't understand that there are no such things as 'no-strings-attached' affairs.  I'm betting Harrison learned that too.", user_id: user1.id, book_id: book14.id })

Nevertheless I have read several of his &#8220;killing book series,&#8221; and I have found them invariably superficial in depth but otherwise well-written and interesting &#8212; written in accordance with marketing techniques for popular, best selling books. &#8220;Killing the Rising Sun: How America Vanquished World War II Japan&#8221; is no different, but it&#8217;s arguably better, if not the best of those I have read so far in the series. The reason for this is perhaps that O&#8217;Reilly is not dealing with a controversial subject, and is free to narrate history with suspense while propounding his usual winning and acceptable populist viewpoint with little risk of possibly offending propriety or violating taboos. This happened very successfully with his book on &#8220;Killing Kennedy.&#8221; With &#8220;Killing Jesus&#8221; he was careful to remain confined in his narrative within the acceptable know facts surrounding the &#8220;historical Jesus&#8221; without theological speculation, and without advancing any new biblical theories or launching new historical research.Second, if you have enjoyed his previous books you will love this one. In this new book, the Japanese are clearly the bad guys for triggering the war in a treacherous and infamous fashion at Pearl Harbor, and O&#8217;Reilly is free to engage in unhindered patriotism,  and supportive of whatever blow America intended and delivered to the vanquished Japanese.

These famous words are now synonymous with the dynamic husband-and-wife team Chip and Joanna Gaines, stars of HGTV&rsquo;s Fixer Upper. As this question fills the airwaves with anticipation, their legions of fans continue to multiply and ask a different series of questions, like&mdash;Who are these people?What&rsquo;s the secret to their success? And is Chip actually that funny in real life? By renovating homes in Waco, Texas, and changing lives in such a winsome and engaging way, Chip and Joanna have become more than just the stars of Fixer Upper, they have become America&rsquo;s new best friends. The Magnolia Story is the first book from Chip and Joanna, offering their fans a detailed look at their life together. From the very first renovation project they ever tackled together, to the project that nearly cost them everything; from the childhood memories that shaped them, to the twists and turns that led them to the life they share on the farm today. They both attended Baylor University in Waco. However, their paths did not cross until Chip checked his car into the local Firestone tire shop where Joanna worked behind the counter. Even back then Chip was a serial entrepreneur who, among other things, ran a lawn care company, sold fireworks, and flipped houses. Soon they were married and living in their first fixer upper. Four children and countless renovations later, Joanna garners the attention of a television producer who notices her work on a blog one day. In The Magnolia Story fans will finally get to join the Gaines behind the scenes and discover:  The time Chip ran to the grocery store and forgot to take their new, sleeping baby Joanna&rsquo;s agonizing decision to close her dream business to focus on raising their children When Chip buys a houseboat, sight-unseen, and it turns out to be a leaky wreck Joanna&rsquo;s breakthrough moment of discovering the secret to creating a beautiful home Harrowing stories of the financial ups and downs as an entrepreneurial couple Memories and photos from Chip and Jo&rsquo;s wedding The significance of the word magnolia and why it permeates everything they do The way the couple pays the popularity of Fixer Upper forward, sharing the success with others, and bolstering the city of Waco along the way  And yet there is still one lingering question for fans of the show: Is Chip really that funny? &ldquo;Oh yeah,&rdquo; says Joanna. &ldquo;He was, and still is, my first fixer upper.&rdquo;", amazon_link: "https://www.amazon.com/Magnolia-Story-Chip-Gaines/dp/0718079183", kobo_link: "https://www.kobo.com/us/en/search?query=The%20Magnolia%20Story%20Mark%20Dagostino", play_link: "https://play.google.com/store/search?c=books&hl=en&q=The%20Magnolia%20Story%20Mark%20Dagostino" })

W. Norton & Company; 1 edition ", date: "December 6, 2016", description: " How a Nobel Prize&#x2013;winning theory of the mind altered our perception of reality.Forty years ago, Israeli psychologists Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky wrote a series of breathtakingly original studies undoing our assumptions about the decision-making process. Their papers showed the ways in which the human mind erred, systematically, when forced to make judgments in uncertain situations. Their work created the field of behavioral economics, revolutionized Big Data studies, advanced evidence-based medicine, led to a new approach to government regulation, and made much of Michael Lewis&#x2019;s own work possible. Kahneman and Tversky are more responsible than anybody for the powerful trend to mistrust human intuition and defer to algorithms.The Undoing Project is about a compelling collaboration between two men who have the dimensions of great literary figures. They became heroes in the university and on the battlefield&#x2015;both had important careers in the Israeli military&#x2015;and their research was deeply linked to their extraordinary life experiences. Amos Tversky was a brilliant, self-confident warrior and extrovert, the center of rapt attention in any room; Kahneman, a fugitive from the Nazis in his childhood, was an introvert whose questing self-doubt was the seedbed of his ideas. They became one of the greatest partnerships in the history of science, working together so closely that they couldn&#x2019;t remember whose brain originated which ideas, or who should claim credit. They flipped a coin to decide the lead authorship on the first paper they wrote, and simply alternated thereafter.This story about the workings of the human mind is explored through the personalities of two fascinating individuals so fundamentally different from each other that they seem unlikely friends or colleagues. In the process they may well have changed, for good, mankind&#x2019;s view of its own mind.", amazon_link: "https://www.amazon.com/Undoing-Project-Friendship-Changed-Minds/dp/0393254593", kobo_link: "https://www.kobo.com/us/en/search?query=The%20Undoing%20Project:%20A%20Friendship%20That%20Changed%20Our%20Minds%20Michael%20Lewis", play_link: "https://play.google.com/store/search?c=books&hl=en&q=The%20Undoing%20Project:%20A%20Friendship%20That%20Changed%20Our%20Minds%20Michael%20Lewis" })

Review.create({ title: "Must release an edited version", rating: 3, body: "With no doubt, I had great fun reading &#8220;The Undoing Project.&#8221;I was introduced to the work of Tversky and Kahneman as a college sophomore in 1988 by my teacher, hydrologist Joseph Harrington, who was a great admirer of their ideas.  The beauty of what is now called &#8220;Prospect Theory&#8221; has inevitably stuck with me since.  It is only in retrospect that I have come to understand it was radical for its time.So I swallowed whole &#8220;Thinking About Thinking&#8221; within a week of having read the Michael Lewis review on Bloomberg.  And I&#8217;ve since really enjoyed the recent near-autobiography of Richard Thaler&#8217;s, as well as many of Dan Ariely&#8217;s books.Well, you don&#8217;t have to believe me on this, but Michael Lewis actually explains the concepts better!No joke, he really does.And he provides an unbelievably deep, personal and sensitive account of the explosive relationship between the two giants.  A very believable account too.  The research done by Michael Lewis really shows.  He&#8217;s had phenomenal access too, it seems.And yet, the book does not hang together terribly well.  Chapters 1 and 8 should not have made it into the book, they ought to have been relegated to the pages of Vanity Fair, where the author regularly provides fantastic material.More to the point, what we have here is a bunch of chapters that, chronological order notwithstanding, do not constitute a book.  The incredible material, the wonderful expositions, the deep insights are all present and correct, but they fail to meld into a narrative.  Even the title of the book, much as it has its roots in the work of Tversky and Kahneman, does not do justice to their contribution.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user2.id, book_id: book17.id })

The book moves at a brisk pace, never dull, and fleshes out the men behind the scientific work.  This vantage point into where Kahneman and Tversky came from, the events that shaped them, their intellectual make-ups, and the alchemy of their partnership is a real treat.  This added depth to the scientists only makes me appreciate their work all the more.

A five-hundred-year-old legend. An ancient curse. A stunning medical mystery. And a pioneering journey into the unknown heart of the world's densest jungle.Since the days of conquistador Hern&#xE1;n Cort&#xE9;s, rumors have circulated about a lost city of immense wealth hidden somewhere in the Honduran interior, called the White City or the Lost City of the Monkey God. Indigenous tribes speak of ancestors who fled there to escape the Spanish invaders, and they warn that anyone who enters this sacred city will fall ill and die. In 1940, swashbuckling journalist Theodore Morde returned from the rainforest with hundreds of artifacts and an electrifying story of having found the Lost City of the Monkey God-but then committed suicide without revealing its location.Three quarters of a century later, bestselling author Doug Preston joined a team of scientists on a groundbreaking new quest. In 2012 he climbed aboard a rickety, single-engine plane carrying the machine that would change everything: lidar, a highly advanced, classified technology that could map the terrain under the densest rainforest canopy. In an unexplored valley ringed by steep mountains, that flight revealed the unmistakable image of a sprawling metropolis, tantalizing evidence of not just an undiscovered city but an enigmatic, lost civilization.Venturing into this raw, treacherous, but breathtakingly beautiful wilderness to confirm the discovery, Preston and the team battled torrential rains, quickmud, disease-carrying insects, jaguars, and deadly snakes. But it wasn't until they returned that tragedy struck: Preston and others found they had contracted in the ruins a horrifying, sometimes lethal-and incurable-disease.Suspenseful and shocking, filled with colorful history, hair-raising adventure, and dramatic twists of fortune, THE LOST CITY OF THE MONKEY GOD is the absolutely true, eyewitness account of one of the great discoveries of the twenty-first century.", amazon_link: "https://www.amazon.com/Lost-City-Monkey-God-Story/dp/1455540005", kobo_link: "https://www.kobo.com/us/en/search?query=The%20Lost%20City%20of%20the%20Monkey%20God:%20A%20True%20Story%20Douglas%20Preston", play_link: "https://play.google.com/store/search?c=books&hl=en&q=The%20Lost%20City%20of%20the%20Monkey%20God:%20A%20True%20Story%20Douglas%20Preston" })

An interesting story by itself. Getting to be part of the crew that went into the Honduran rainforest to see if there was any accuracy to the stories of ancient cities was just amazing!Next, to try to understand that the archeological community is as ridiculously petulant as it is, rather broke my heart. I realize I'm being naive in this regard but I had hoped that the scholarly community wouldn't be so politically aligned.Another aspect of the book I found interesting was the possible reasons the ancient cities were abandoned. The fierce spread of disease introduced by European explorers and it's incredible rate of spread. Also interesting was the possible reasons for the different reasons disease developed so differently in the old and new world's.Finally, the evolution of ancient disease into modern disease and it's potential affect on our global society.All of these things were so amazingly well covered.

According to historian Joseph Ellis,&#160;Alexander Hamilton&#160;is &ldquo;a robust full-length portrait, in my view the best ever written, of the most brilliant, charismatic and dangerous founder of them all.&rdquo;Few figures in American history have been more hotly debated or more grossly misunderstood than Alexander Hamilton. Chernow&rsquo;s biography gives Hamilton his due and sets the record straight, deftly illustrating that the political and economic greatness of today&rsquo;s America is the result of Hamilton&rsquo;s countless sacrifices to champion ideas that were often wildly disputed during his time. &ldquo;To repudiate his legacy,&rdquo; Chernow writes, &ldquo;is, in many ways, to repudiate the modern world.&rdquo; Chernow here recounts Hamilton&rsquo;s turbulent life: an illegitimate, largely self-taught orphan from the Caribbean, he came out of nowhere to take America by storm, rising to become George Washington&rsquo;s aide-de-camp in the Continental Army, coauthoring The Federalist Papers, founding the Bank of New York, leading the Federalist Party, and becoming the first Treasury Secretary of the United States.Historians have long told the story of America&rsquo;s birth as the triumph of Jefferson&rsquo;s democratic ideals over the aristocratic intentions of Hamilton. Chernow presents an entirely different man, whose legendary ambitions were motivated not merely by self-interest but by passionate patriotism and a stubborn will to build the foundations of American prosperity and power. His is a Hamilton far more human than we&rsquo;ve encountered before&mdash;from his shame about his birth to his fiery aspirations, from his intimate relationships with childhood friends to his titanic feuds with Jefferson, Madison, Adams, Monroe, and Burr, and from his highly public affair with Maria Reynolds to his loving marriage to his loyal wife Eliza. And never before has there been a more vivid account of Hamilton&rsquo;s famous and mysterious death in a duel with Aaron Burr in July of 1804.Chernow&rsquo;s biography is not just a portrait of Hamilton, but the story of America&rsquo;s birth seen through its most central figure. At a critical time to look back to our roots,&#160;Alexander Hamilton&#160;will remind readers of the purpose of our institutions and our heritage as Americans.&ldquo;Nobody has captured Hamilton better than Chernow&rdquo;&#160;&mdash;The New York Times Book Review&#160;", amazon_link: "https://www.amazon.com/Alexander-Hamilton-Ron-Chernow/dp/0143034758", kobo_link: "https://www.kobo.com/us/en/ebooks", play_link: "https://play.google.com/store/search?c=books&hl=en&q=Alexander%20Hamilton%20Ron%20Chernow" })

When I heard of Hamilton on Broadway, I immediately got myself tickets and started rereading this gem of a book. Hamilton's life is like a movie, full of trials and tribulations, drama and chock full of accomplishments. I don't think Hamilton gets the credit he deserves. He basically founded the principles modern America is based on, granted he built his model borrowing from ideas from other places but it's still a marvel. He was astute enough to see that the U.S would be a capitalist nation versus Jefferson's favored agrarian society. Mr. Chernow does a brilliant job of chronicling his life from his humble beginnings to the end of his life after his duel with Burr. I must admit some parts of the book are quite dry, especially when he's talking about the financial system, it goes over my head but it's so well written, so well researched and is one of my all time favorite books.", user_id: user1.id, book_id: book19.id })

Review.create({ title: "Historical Perspective and Compelling Style", rating: 5, body: "Current political debates, ubiquitous in the news, are put into historical perspective by reading this book. Documents like the Constitution, and federal government powers to tax and regulate, were not taken for granted at the outset; and political differences of opinion were not merely debated but were settled by means as extreme as dueling to the death.Alexander Hamilton was probably the most significant Founding Father who was never elected to the Presidency (all right, maybe Franklin too).  His life, while truncated, put him at the forefront of all the issues of early day America. Perhaps the reason this book is fascinates me is because it presents each issue both from Hamiltons viewpoint and from his opponents viewpoints; and often there was compelling logic on both sides. For example, should the debts incurred by the individual states in fighting the Revolutionary War be paid off by the federal government? On the one hand, the victory benefitted the whole country, and individual state taxes would conflict with federal taxing powers; but on the other, some of the states had already done a good job of paying down their debts on their own. Also of interest was the difference in perspective between Hamiltons dream of America as a manufacturing powerhouse and a strong united nation, versus Jeffersons as an agrarian society with emphasis on states rights. Hamilton set up a logical monetary system that would be a foundation for long-term economic strength to the nation, but there were reasons for people to mistrust it (and him, as a result). Disputes between major players were often philosophical, but sometimes personal events got entangled too. This book really fills in the gaps in understanding American history but manages to be much more interesting than the history books I was required to read as a young student. It is jam-packed with historical content but remarkably readable as a story.", user_id: user5.id, book_id: book19.id })

Review.create({ title: "A brilliant book by a brilliant mind. BE SKEPTICAL ANYWAY.", rating: 5, body: "Back in 1994, Massimo Piattelli-Palmarini, Director of the Institute of San Raffaele in Milan, Italy, wrote a charming little book about common cognitive distortions called Inevitable Illusions. It is probably the very first comprehensive summary of behavioral economics intended for general audience. In it, he predicted that the two psychologists behind behavioral economics - Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman - would win the Nobel prize. I didn't disagree with the sentiment, but wondered how in the world were they going to get it since these two were psychologists and there is no Nobel prize in psychology. I didn't think there was much chance of them winning the Nobel Prize in economics. I was wrong and Piattelli-Palmarini was right. Kahneman won the Nobel prize in Economic Sciences. (Tversky unfortunately prematurely passed away by this time.) Just as Steve Jobs who was not in the music industry revolutionized it, the non-economists Kahneman and Tversky have revolutionized economic thinking. I have known Kahneman's work for quite some time and was quite excited to see that he was coming out with a non-technical version of his research. My expectations for the book were high and I wasn't disappointed.Since other reviewers have given an excellent summary of the book, I will be brief in my summary but review the book more broadly.The basis thesis of the book is simple. In judging the world around us, we use two mental systems: Fast and Slow.  The Fast system (System 1) is mostly unconscious and makes snap judgments based on our past experiences and emotions. When we use this system we are as likely to be wrong as right. The Slow system (System 2) is rational, conscious and slow. They work together to provide us a view of the world around us.So what's the problem?Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user3.id, book_id: book20.id })

Not only do we mis-assess situations, but we do so following fairly predictable patterns. Moreover, those patterns are grounded in our primate ancestry.The first observation, giving the title to the book, is that eons of natural selection gave us the ability to make a fast reaction to a novel situation. Survival depended on it. So, if we hear an unnatural noise in the bushes, our tendency is to run. Thinking slow, applying human logic, we might reflect that it is probably Johnny coming back from the Girl Scout camp across the river bringing cookies, and that running might not be the best idea. However, fast thinking is hardwired.The first part of the book is dedicated to a description of the two systems, the fast and slow system. Kahneman introduces them in his first chapter as system one and system two.Chapter 2 talks about the human energy budget. Thinking is metabolically expensive; 20 percent of our energy intake goes to the brain. Moreover, despite what your teenager tells you, dedicating energy to thinking about one thing means that energy is not available for other things. Since slow thinking is expensive, the body is programmed to avoid it.Chapter 3 expands on this notion of the lazy controller. We don't invoke our slow thinking, system two machinery unless it is needed. It is expensive. As an example, try multiplying two two-digit numbers in your head while you are running. You will inevitably slow down.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user5.id, book_id: book20.id })

More specifically, the two systems (fast and slow), basically how you suck at thinking, and finally 'the two selves.' Technically, the book is broken up into five parts - two systems, heuristics & biases, overconfidence, choices, and finally the two selves.Page 20 starts off his quick definitions of the two systems. System 1 is automatic and works quickly with little to no effort. System 2 'allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it' and this usually requires concentration and can be interrupted and disrupted.The middle three sections could possibly be rearranged but essentially include research biases, design, and problems (fallacies, sample size issues, etc.). This part of the book will blow your mind. It is unbelievable some of the things that affect research, especially anchoring. It should make you terrified to ever go before a judge.Finally, the two selves. This is basically the self that exists (or existed, experienced something) and the 'remembering' self, not necessarily what happened, but what you remember happening. The implications of these two differing selves have far reaching affects. As an example, researchers had two groups of people that underwent a procedure. One group experienced the procedure and long with a high peak of pain, and then slowly fading out. The other group had a shorter experience, but didn't fade as much, but also didn't peak as much.The participants rated pain levels during the event.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user9.id, book_id: book20.id })

Now everyone has different aspects on success. Outliers digs a little deeper, and talks about well-known people and their journey to success and fame. Personality I like how the author focused on more than one person or thought. Throughout the chapters there were different stories and different characters which gave the book more variety. Each chapter pulled you deeper into the story and plot.  The one thing I wasnt a fan of in this book, is that it was very difficult to follow along or understand. Dont get me wrong I loved the individuality of each chapter, but in a regular story each chapter tells you more about the characters and setting. On the other hand Outliers is a completely different concept. The story can be very hard to follow and understand at times, when it jumps from story to story. You may misunderstand a sentence or two and have to go back and read it over again. I certainly did.  Now this book is not for everyone, what book is, but I would highly recommend this to anyone who likes non-fictional books, or to anyone looking for a deep read.

Review.create({ title: "A people pleaser for the masses", rating: 3, body: "I usually love all the books I read since I am very selective. However this was a let down for a number of reasons:1. While it started off strongly, it rapidly fell off in all aspects about a third in. The writing was less to the point, the points were less groundbreaking, and seemed to be supported by rather anecdotal observations. It had a comeback here and there, but the majority of the book as weak imo.2. Overdone storytelling. About 1/5th of the book is spent on a chapter on plane crashes. He makes a very smart and interesting point, but that point was made after about 30 minutes, yet he kept going bringing example after example in excruciating detail. This is closely related to point 1 as it appears that as substance decreased, the exposition of description increased.3. His stance is too extreme. If the tale of the self made man is one extreme, then outliers is the other extreme as it basically attempts to discredit the successful and say it was all due to luck. He keeps mentioning Bill Gates and how &#34;lucky&#34; he was to have a computer in his school. He also mentions that there were only a handful of school at the time to have such a computer. Well a handful of schools say 12? With say 1000 students on average each? That means 12,000 others had the same chance as him. 12,000 that did not program all night long, to learn this new skill, but rather chose to play ball or worry about boys/girls. While we can discredit everyone by the logic of &#34;if X did not happen, he would not have accomplished Y&#34;, the truth is this Malcolm: We are around so much opportunity, more so now than ever, that it's less a question of whether there is opportunity, nut whether we take advantage of it. You are correct that now I'd have a harder time creating my own operating system, that ship has sailed, I agree, but that is looking at success with a very narrow lense. There is always an opportune industry for one to break into, and all it takes is seizing those opportunities. As with your mother, you mention in the Epilogue, if it were not for someone having given her money to go to school, things would have been very different. Don't you think that is selling her short? I'm sure she would have kept asking until she found someone else to give her money.The true story of success is that successful people will not let their story be changed by adding or removing a variable from their path, they will keep fighting and find something to replace that variable. That's why some of the most successful people have been declined or faced defeat (be it investors, agents, etc.) over a hundred times and kept going. If you'd go back and take away their investor, its safe to say they would have kept going to another 100 and eventually found someone else. And that attitude, as you may claim, is not a stone cold result of legacy, as both those born of a privileged background as well as those with the most painful of pasts have those attitudes... because an attitude is decided in the moment, not something we are born with or given.In conclusion, it is an interesting read if you want to learn more about people, but take it with a grain of salt. This is NOT personal development, or anything of the sort in case you think this is a book I read and learn to be successful... quite contrary the message appears to comfort those that don't have success and blame society, and poke those with success implying that whatever they have was not earned.", user_id: user2.id, book_id: book21.id })
Review.create({ title: "Parent or Not to Parent", rating: 5, body: "Reading Gladwell is like arguing with yourself.  In so many of his books I find myself in a knee jerk denial  with his initial assertions, only to acquiesce, if not completely at least by a measurable amount.  One thing I will say about Outliers is that, while Gladwell doesn't come out and promote it this way, the information in the book is tremendous for parents such as myself.  Specific scenes in the book almost encourage you to get more active in your childrens' lives immediately.  I agree with the premise of the book to a point.  While I believe that environment and date of birth, surrounding influences and circumstances play a tremendous role in the development of an individual, I also believe the individual has some control over several of these factors.  By emphasizing the importance of circumstance Gladwell encouraged me to pay more attention to my &#34;surroundings&#34; and try to find ways to influence those which I could control so that those circumstances could in turn benefit me, family, friends, associates, and on and on.  I disagree that if more kids had access to computers at the same time Bill Gates had access then we would have thousands of Microsofts.  I believe we could possible have many more computer programmers and professionals as well as a few more operating systems but there has always been and there will always be the exceptions (outliers) on both ends of the spectrum.  If the outlier was not Bill Gates with his computer time then it would have been somebody else with his/her computer time and another factor.  I call it the &#34;plus 1 effect.&#34;Acknowledging while refraining from complete buy in on the premise, I consider this a must read book especially for parents.  This book encouraged me to speak to my wife on the merits of finding the slopes of lines and growing rice.

Review.create({ title: "Don't read Coates' book - read this one!", rating: 5, body: "If you really want to know the extent of white privilege and how it survives given that most Americans are not outwardly racist anymore, this is the book for you. As Michelle Alexander points out in great detail, white privilege exists today in America in the form of mass incarceration, the generic term for the fact that despite being a supposedly &#34;free&#34; country, we manage to imprison more of our citizens than any other country on earth, even Russia or China.  But more than that, a very high percentage of these people are black, and in fact they go to prison at a rate disproportionate to the frequency with which they commit crimes. To be blunt, if you are caught selling illegal drugs in most states, you are likely to go to prison if you are black, but you will more likely get treated more leniently if you are white.  It's worse than that, because, unlike most other developed nations, we make certain that once someone is convicted of a felony, he loses the vote, his right to public housing, the ability to get a job, in other words, he can be discriminated against for life.  But he committed the crime so he deserves it, right?  Not so fast - whereas whites commit many crimes at the same rate as blacks or even higher, especially drug crimes, they go to prison much less often.  Blacks have to be perfect - dot their i's and cross all their t's.  It's not realistic, and it's unfair.Alexander points out that this is nothing more than a new system to marginalize and discriminate against blacks, and calls it &#34;the new Jim Crow&#34;.  If anything, it's more accurate to call it the new slavery.  Just go to Angola State Prison in Louisiana and watch all the black prisoners working in the cotton fields.  Look familiar?  Now how did this happen?  How did the number of Americans behind bars go from 350,000 (still a high number) to over 2 million in the last 30-40 years?  A large part of it was the War on Drugs, started by Nixon around 1970.  Alexander traces the history of the drug war, and describes how it became a vehicle for mistreating blacks even in the face of prevalent &#34;colorblind&#34; attitudes of most Americans today.  We don't directly label blacks as inferior and make them ride the back of the bus today, we just try real hard to get them labeled as felons, then we can discriminate.  And most Americans don't realize we're doing it and how much damage this causes.  It's also expensive and a waste of taxpayer dollars.In the final chapters Alexander offers some ideas on how to dismantle this system.  It's very hard, and it's not enough to file lawsuits in individual cases.  It requires a major protest movement.  Many things have to be undone, such as the entire drug war, disenfranchisement laws, the management of prisons by private corporations to name a few. But the resistance will be huge because many jobs would disappear, and no one wants to be seen making life better for criminals.  Also, colorblindness won't do - we need to be conscious of racial differences yet driven to treat everyone with respect, fairness and kindness.  It's a totally different mindset for most Americans.  Especially fascinating was her description of how such concessions, or &#34;racial bribes&#34;, as affirmative action serve to justify continuing the system as it is.  Affirmative action has helped a lot of blacks become successful, but it glosses over the main problem.  The fact that we have a black President also obscures the real issues.Alexander states also that a full treatment of how to fix this problem would require another book, and I eagerly await that.

Review.create({ title: "Powerful but Repetitive", rating: 4, body: "I struck a star from this book because the writing is repetitive and self-righteous to the point of being cringe worthy at times. Still, the core message is extremely powerful: the current system of control over blacks is the most implicit and insidious in our nation's history, and will not go away without radical social and governmental change. This book really helped me, a white reader, better understand the origins of black anger and frustration, gangsta culture, and the hollow gains of black exceptionalism.If you're an American not interested in race, you should be. Alexander makes the good point that America's situation is unique: we are an immigrant nation (including millions of descendants of forced immigrants) in a world otherwise divided along ethnic lines. We have huge problems that no other nation has ever needed or wanted to solve, yet we've been unwilling throughout our history to get to the core of the issues. To somemyself included, before reading this bookrace relations in American history may seem curiously backward. After reading this book, I've come to appreciate why race relations in the US are so damn hard and why it will take a massive movementnothing short of a revolution in the structure of law and the American cultural consciousnessto make real progress.", user_id: user3.id, book_id: book23.id })

They are the ones who prefer listening to speaking; who innovate and create but dislike self-promotion; who favor working on their own over working in teams. It is to introverts&mdash;Rosa Parks, Chopin, Dr. Seuss, Steve Wozniak&mdash;that we owe many of the great contributions to society.&#160;In Quiet, Susan Cain argues that we dramatically undervalue introverts and shows how much we lose in doing so. She charts the rise of the Extrovert Ideal throughout the twentieth century and explores how deeply it has come to permeate our culture. She also introduces us to successful introverts&mdash;from a witty, high-octane public speaker who recharges in solitude after his talks, to a record-breaking salesman who quietly taps into the power of questions. Passionately argued, superbly researched, and filled with indelible stories of real people, Quiet has the power to permanently change how we see introverts and, equally important, how they see themselves.Now with Extra Libris material, including a reader&rsquo;s guide and bonus content", amazon_link: "https://www.amazon.com/Quiet-Power-Introverts-World-Talking/dp/0307352153", kobo_link: "https://www.kobo.com/us/en/search?query=Quiet:%20The%20Power%20of%20Introverts%20in%20a%20World%20That%20Can't%20Stop%20Talking%20Susan%20Cain", play_link: "https://play.google.com/store/search?c=books&hl=en&q=Quiet:%20The%20Power%20of%20Introverts%20in%20a%20World%20That%20Can't%20Stop%20Talking%20Susan%20Cain" })

I'm not prone to melodrama, or to such excessively long reviews, but this is true, and so important to me, I have to say it.  I've been working for years in an extremely busy law office.  It's been growing harder and harder throughout the years for me to handle this job.  Two months ago my boss fired my coworker, and I've since had to take on two people's work plus train multiple new people (as the first two didn't stay), all with constant, all day long interruptions, high-intensity demands, and a high level of multitasking.  This has happened many times before, and while it was dreadful, I managed, but for some reason this time I just couldn't handle it.  My entire life has been on hold since this started, I get home from work too exhausted to do anything except veg out for a couple hours and go to bed, and even weekends aren't much better.  I was taking terrible care of myself and my life was falling apart.  I did, in fact, feel like I was killing myself with this lifestyle, but I simply did not have the energy to fix any of it, or for that matter have any idea how to fix it.I blamed myself - there must be something `wrong with me' because I can't handle the job.  I wanted to leave, but thought, if I can't handle this job, how am I going to handle a new job?  It'll probably be more of the same.  I thought I was just getting soft because I was getting older (I'm in my late 40s).I've always known I was introverted, but I didn't realize just what all that entailed - I thought it mostly meant `shy' or that I didn't like social settings.This book taught me more about myself than I've ever known.  It read like my biography.  Almost every page had a new insight into why I think and feel the way I do.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user1.id, book_id: book24.id })

One cannot expect people handicapped with extroversion to be able to think deeply or meditate over the serious philosophical, scientific, or supremely artistic subjects which move the deeper among us.Okay, maybe extroversion is not a handicap, but it is important to realize that introversion is no more a handicap than extroversion.  So, the extroverts deserve a retaliatory jab once in a while for treating introverts as though we are mentally and socially challenged.This book by Susan Cain is the ultimate jab, though she is sometimes overnice toward the ones that have promoted The Extrovert Ideal for more than a century in the U.S.  I do not believe I have read any better work dealing with the issue of personality than Quiet.There are some scientific points to be made in the book, with mention of studies that show how introversion or extroversion are biologically, genetically ingrained in us, though some of the studies (particularly the one mentioning literal thin skin) strike me as somewhat irrelevant if not pseudoscientific.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user7.id, book_id: book24.id })

As somebody who has been called at some point or another the gamut of terms associated with introversion, from shy (which I don't object) to anti-social (which I most certainly consider unfair), I found in Susan Cain's Quiet, the validation and appreciation many introverts have been searching for.In Quiet, Ms. Cain explains the rise of the Extrovert Ideal in the 1920s and how it is that today we associate talkative, risk-taking, and action-oriented people with intelligence, beauty, power and success.  The Extrovert Ideal is so pervasive that influences our work performance, educational policies, political choices, and even the country's financial health.  But the focus of Quiet is on exposing the myths and misunderstandings that were born when we as a culture embraced the Extrovert Ideal and turned introversion into a malady to be avoided.To dispel the misconception that introversion is some kind of sickness or weirdness, Ms. Cain traces both the biological and cultural basis for introversion and extroversion and their role as evolutionary survival strategies in animals and humans.  She interviews scientists who have conducted hundreds of studies to test different theories in an effort to determine how much of our temperament is a result of genetics and/or of our free will.The best part of Quiet is that the insights gleaned from these studies can help introverts take advantage of their special traits and thrive on their own terms in an extroverted world.  Since introversion and extroversion are preferences for a certain level of outside stimulation, Ms. Cain advises introverts to find their sweet spot --or what scientists call the optimal level of arousal.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user12.id, book_id: book24.id })

Review.create({ title: "Unfried Chicken... Who Knew?", rating: 5, body: "When it comes to books, Oprah Winfrey and a book recommendation tend to go hand in hand. So, when it was decided that Oprah would release a cookbook, even though I am a fan, even I was skeptical. I asked my sister, Isnt she using Weight Watchers? How does that fit in? Second, she really doesnt need the money!Like Oprah, my sister and I struggled with our weight. We tried everything. I mean absolutely everything. Thanks to a little book called The Hungry Chick Dieting Solution, which has become the best kept secret to weight loss, I really lost 11 pounds, and that sluggish feeling from the extra weight, since my kids went back to school in the fall. I have been working hard not to do anything to mess that up.So, my sister convinced me to get this book. If my sister recommends a book, I tend to go get it. She recommended The Hungry Chick Dieting Solution to me years ago, and it took for me seeing a bunch of other mentions about it to finally go get it. I apologize, lets get back to Oprah.Let me start out by saying, even before you get to some of the most amazing recipes ever, this book is made with love. It is so beautifully done that I dont want to muck it up with flour or splashes of oil from my kitchen. Its also very candid. Flipping through, I love the story about Lassie and even as a fan, I learned a better way to make tomato soup. Soup is love. That is my favorite chapter.For all the people that struggled, like I did with WW points, many moons ago. The point system is there. But, this isnt a WW book. Instead, it will introduce you to amazing dishes, that will either get you back into the kitchen or inspire you to make your own. From the Unfried Chicken, who knew, to the Turkey Lasagna. The sorbet, I have had before, but it was interesting enough, if you havent. This really is a great book. Great food, no regrets. I just wish it had been available before Christmas. It would have made an awesome gift. Other than that, I highly recommend it.If you are serious about eating healthier and following Oprahs push to eat more clean, with less processed foods, I also highly recommend that you also buy, or even borrow from your local library, The Hungry Chick Dieting Solution.

No sarcasm, no snark.DISCLAIMER: I am a Tim Ferriss apologist. I've listened to almost every episode of his podcast. Own his books. Have been following him since 4 Hour Work Week came out.Tim's podcast has rewired my brain. My life is measurably better because of what I've learned. Literally. I have hereditary cholesterol problems and my forays into a ketogenic lifestyle dropped my particle count from ~1950 to ~1225. There are many other great things that have come as a result of my exposure to Tim's podcast, too many to list here.When he announced TOOLS OF TITANS, I was ecstatic. I pre-ordered this book in September.I'm sad to say that I'm non-plussed, borderline disappointed.On one hand, I love having a &#34;totem&#34; of something that has changed my life so profoundly. To that end, I am happy to own the book.On the other hand, it does not deliver on its promise. This is supposedly a &#34;recipe book&#34; (according to page xvi in the Foreword).It is no such thing.If I want to bake an apple pie, I go to the Table of Contents, I look up apple pie, I turn to that page.You cannot do that in this book.Tim has amazing things to say about meditation. A few guests on his podcast have amazing things to say about meditation (Sam Harris, Naval Ravikant, Kevin Rose, etc.).But there is no central place to which you can turn to find out the collected wisdom of the many guests who have delved into this topic.The same goes for investing. The same goes for particular health hacks.In fact, there's not even one central place in the book that gives a list of the commonalities between the guests. That's a HUGE missed opportunity.THE ADVICE:Make a second edition. Soon. It doesn't even have to add new content. Just tighten this up and make it so that you can read about certain topics in a centralized place. If there are parts that don't fit, maybe have an author section at the back... but, dang.FINAL THOUGHT:Millionaires become millionaires (in part) because they've learned to say &#34;no.&#34; They have the discipline to turn down the good, so that they can pursue (and achieve) the great.This book is just too too too much good. It doesn't tell you what is great. It will leave you chasing dozens upon dozens of random tactics and thoughts in a dozen different fields.It might teach the tactics and routines and habits of world-class performers, but there's FAR TOO MUCH here to make it valuable in showing YOU how to achieve those heights. And, if there is ONE person that you could model to become like them in their field... there is FAR TOO LITTLE here to actually help you on your way.", user_id: user3.id, book_id: book27.id })
Review.create({ title: "Good not great, and I want great from Tim.", rating: 3, body: "Tim's previous books are incredible and you should buy them all. Those books show incredible mission, clarity, and voice.This book suffers from the expectations of his previous work--Tim is honest about presenting &#34;Tools of Titans&#34; as sort of a glimpse of his journals/notes from his life's work, but this book loses nearly everything we've come to expect.First, due to the content (it's a compendium of quips/quotes/summations from past work and in particular, his podcasts) there's no sense of mission and the book feels scattered. Yes, you can sort of pick this up book and it reads like a reference digest, but Tim's voice fades and it feels without purpose. It's WebMD with a clouded personality...it's a bit like a bound website without the hyperlinking.Next, keeping Tim's literary voice at the fringe makes the book far less interesting. His personality is buried, his sense of adventure and joyous curiosity isn't apparent, so we care less about the character and the journey. His books have always succeeded on those terms--he's made us excited about his life and why he does what he does, but here his character is almost non-existent.Finally, although I don't think it's the case, the book doesn't seem challenging for Tim. I don't think he phoned it in, and I know trying to make sense of a lifetime's worth of notes (tools!) was incredibly challenging, but there's a part of me as a reader that expected much more channeled insight. He's shown he's capable of completely rethinking a problem or a lifestyle or a way of doing things, and this book isn't like that at all.If you've read all of Tim's stuff and listened to a fair amount of his podcasts, this book is going to seem like familiar territory. Nice to have some of the best nuggets all in one spot, but I don't buy his books out of convenience. If you're new to Tim Ferris, this is probably a decent starting point.", user_id: user4.id, book_id: book27.id })

But as a therapist, I am concerned that the &#34;badass&#34; attitude that the author holds toward the reader is potentially damaging. Several times in the first 1/2 of the book (which was all I could stomach) she declares that you are a wimp if you don't follow her ideas or methods. Ick. This totally goes against the basic premise of the law of attraction. There are so many books on manifesting that are more comprehensive and respectful to the reader. And the information is not rocket surgery. Here are the basics:1. Self limiting beliefs that you formed from early negative experiences hold you back from doing what you would most love.2. Those same beliefs are likely creating self-criticism, anxiety and depression in you, which also holds you back.3. Learning to love yourself (by practicing doing loving things and speaking to yourself kindly and compassionately) will eventually shift your beliefs. You can speed up this process with repetition (mantras, affirmations, etc.).4. If all the spiritual, woo-woo talk about frequencies and vibrations makes you roll your eyes, no worries. It is your own energy that creates the relationships, experiences and perceptions you have. You know this from experience. When you are having a great day, the world looks brighter. People seem friendlier (because they are responding to your warmth). When your day is sucking, everyone becomes a pain in the butt.5. Staying in a loving space with yourself requires ongoing maintenance and support. You will do better if you limit contact with people who make you feel bad or doubt yourself and increase contact with those you make you feel stronger and happier.6.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user2.id, book_id: book28.id })

I was literally prepared to go out and buy three more volumes for my friends.Until Chapter 17.About halfway through the book, Sincero begins talking about excuses. Okay, yes. A valuable thing to discuss. People, myself included, make excuses all the time. But she decides to target a set group of people.People who are clinically depressed. She says, and I'm paraphrasing here, that depression is a comfort because it gives those who suffer from it an excuse not to do anything but stay in bed....And that is precisely when I tuned out. I went from loving everything she said to eye rolling in a matter of seconds.My clinical depression is not an excuse. It isn't me being lazy. It isn't me snickering as I back out on plans I make with friends. It's me literally being unable to do anything because my disease is keeping me from doing it. There are days where I can't do anything at all. There are days where laundry piles up and my bedroom becomes a disaster and I hide away from the world because I don't think I'm worthy of being seen. There are days where I stop seeing my friends because I feel like I'm a burden to them.And my friends understand this. They know what I go through and they know that if I need some time to myself to get my brain under control, then it isn't an excuse. It doesn't mean I don't love them. It means that I'm just dealing with negative thoughts and I need to work through it. The fact that Sincero completely misunderstands depression ruined this book for me instantly. Yes, I will admit she gives valuable advice.

If you've read other self help books then you probably won't find much that's new here. In fact, it's really the in-your-face tone and humor in her writing that makes this book worthwhile. As for her ideas, I personally found a lot to take issue with. First, she has a very polarized view of spiritual growth that divides our lives in to those that suck and those that are awesome. Maybe that works for young millennials just starting out in life, and if that's the audience she&#8217;s g oing for, then great, but most of us are somewhere on a continuum and her assertions that life is either this way or that way are simplistic to say the least. Sincero also uses a lot of highly critical, edgy language to describe people who are struggling or stuck - therefore not as awesome as she is - using words like &#34;lame-o &#34; &#34;suck&#34; &#34;wuss&#34;  ...well, you get the idea. This may be mildly amusing the first time around, but it gets old fast and it's not exactly kind to those who may really be struggling. I have to confess that I question a writer who continually references her own life choices and personal career success as a model that the rest of us should follow. There is an exhibitionistic, narcissistic, &#34;look at me&#34;, &#34;look at how successful I am&#34; dimension running through this book that is self-indulgent while lacking insight about what success could mean or look like for another person.  Read this book for a quick shot of motivation if that's what you need, it's good for that, but look elsewhere for help in developing your own ideas and values about  success and purpose.

(hi, meg!)The absolute BEST thing about Whole30 is that it simply is not a diet. I first stumbled upon Whole30 after two different friends--from two different friend circles--discussed this 30 day &#34;plan&#34; they were completing. As one girl whined and moaned about not being able to chew gum, I naturally took that as a challenge and thought: I'll do this Whole30 and not be such a baby about it. I read the Whole30 blog, I used Instagram as a means to gather additional recipes and helpful hints, and ten days later, I began day one. Surprisingly, I found it to be the BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED to my little round self. I gained confidence, learned that I do have the ability to say &#34;no&#34; to food cravings, discovered a myriad of new recipes, cured all of my PCOS symptoms (regular menstrual cycles for the first time in ten years and no cysts), and as a bonus, dropped 2 pants sizes. As a child, I was in and out of the hospital with stomach pains and problems (I'll spare all the details) and after following Melissa & Dallas' Whole30, I ate sans stomach aches for the first time EVER. Truly, I did not know that was possible. For my entire life eating a meal meant some level of pain/discomfort while my food digested. Not anymore! Also, chronic migraines: gone!Whole30 can be a challenge, but it isn't hard. It's worth it.About this book: LAWD, HAVE MERCY! It's beautiful. I'm leaving it on my coffee table forever. (Confession: I did, in fact, walk back and forth from my kitchen to my coffee table while I cooked tonight because I didn't want to risk getting food on the new pages. It's brand new and I'm in love, okay?) It presents all information necessary to complete Whole30, informs one about all rules, discusses the importance of following the rules, and provides a plethora of recipes and resources. (They went above and beyond here, people.) The photography is amazing. The typography is stunning. The recipes are delicious. And, may I say again that the book is just so incredibly BEAUTIFUL?From one wonder woman to another wonder (wo)man, you must buy the book. Give Whole30 a try.

Review.create({ title: "Just finished my first whole30! The results are amazing!", rating: 5, body: "This book has simply changed my life. I know that you aren't supposed to weigh yourself on this program, but weighing myself is a motivator so I decided to skip that rule. It's only been two weeks and already I feel so much better. I am more alert in the mornings and my acid reflex is gone. In addition, my migraines seemed to have disappeared entirely. What is really motivating me is the fact that I lost 15 pounds and 10 overall inches in two weeks. I also love the fact that I have the energy to exercise again. I look forward to continuing this program even after my 30 days are up. I just feel that healthy and energetic! I'll post an update once my 30 days are complete. :)Update: So today is day 18 on my Whole30 journey. I just wanted to let you guys know that there is a lot of cooking involved with this program. I'm actually tired of cooking, which is why I started making large meals to freeze for the week. It actually works out well for me, especially since I don't mind eating the same food everyday. I've also been drinking a lot of tea and water. I feel like it is helping to flush out more toxins from my body. I has been approximately four days since my previous review and I lost an additional 2 pounds on this journey. I have so much energy that I actually am unable to sit still like I used to. I guess I was depressed before going on this journey so the Whole30 has actually improved my mood as well. I go for a walk every day and I've actually started a new workout program!Update: So I just finished Day 23 of my Whole30 Journey and I feel good, aside from the fact that I caught a cold. Weighing myself today, I discovered that I lost 19.5 pounds so far! I measured myself and immediately noted that I lost 19 inches over all (I measure my chest, both arms, both legs, waist, and hips). I think when I am done with my first round, I'll take a day off then start a second round. I just feel that great overall.Update: So I just finished my first whole30 round and I have to say that I'm super excited by the results. When I hopped on the scale today, I noticed that I had lost 26.6 pounds. I then measured myself and noted that I lost a total of 31.5 inches (-5&#34; from chest, -2&#34; from right arm, -3.5&#34; from left arm, -8&#34; from waist, -5&#34; from hips, -4&#34; from right thigh, and -4&#34; from left thigh). I am really excited by my results!I plan to have a celebratory dinner tonight (likely a gluten free pizza from papa Murphy's), then I will start my second round of whole30 tomorrow. I think that I might actually reach my goal of losing 50 pounds by August!I'll keep you guys posted! If you have any questions, feel free to comment. I will do my best to answer them. :)", user_id: user2.id, book_id: book29.id })

Instead of trying to keep track of all the continual debates on diet, the authors have created a plan for you to find out what works best for you (as well as what makes you feel like junk.) The 30 days were difficult, don't get me wrong, but it was so empowering to resist my cravings! I sleep better, have a better mood, lost weight and fat so now I look lean and muscular! (Confession: I used to work out everyday but once I started the program I didn't have enough time to exercise so no, I didn't reach these results from hitting the gym; it's all about food.)It is a lot of work and a lot of time spent in the kitchen so I recommend that you wait until the time is right for you. You should give the program 100% effort and if you are too stressed, busy, or just don't have the time to make all of this homemade food you will probably get discouraged and fall off track. But if you think you can fit it into your life, get a support group together and start right away, it will change your life!Last thing: the recipes are phenomenal! I have been in a cooking rut for the past year and these recipes have cured me. I was so shocked that meal after meal was a delight to eat. So even if you don't do the program this is a worth-while purchase for the recipes alone. Just make sure you actually follow the entire recipe...

That is not the case with the new recipe book.Some points I wish were different:1) Many of the recipes are complicated, like REALLY complicated. Some requiring as many as 20 ingredients to complete. Others require uncommon ingredients, which will likely not be reused, especially if there isn't another recipe in the book asking for it. Something I appreciated in the 30 Day Guide was that ingredients were frequently used in more than one recipe so they were worth the investment.2) There is a big step up in the use of tree nuts in the cookbook. I never really got why tree nuts would be included in an anti-inflammatory diet when they are one of the more common allergens. Aside from that, I'm super allergic to tree nuts (need an epi-pen) so this was, personally, lame for me. Nuts were easy to avoid in 30 Day Guide but many more recipes include them in the cookbook.3) A lot of the recipes are what some would consider &#34;exotic&#34; and may need to be sold to kids. Sure, not everyone buying the book has kids but a lot of us do so let's keep it simple. I appreciate some exotic dishes (especially Indian and African foods) here and there and I encourage my kids to try variety but... really... I need more simple recipes that won't meet opposition. Simple, uncomplicated foods without a tons of strong spices. Complicated dishes are appreciated in moderation in cookbooks, not nearly every recipe.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user8.id, book_id: book30.id })

After losing the one thing that would have allowed her to protect the Timeline, and the one person worth fighting for, Etta awakens alone in an unknown place and time, exposed to the threat of the two groups who would rather see her dead than succeed. When help arrives, it comes from the last person Etta ever expectedJulian Ironwood, the Grand Masters heir who has long been presumed dead, and whose dangerous alliance with a man from Ettas past could put them both at risk.Meanwhile, Nicholas and Sophia are racing through time in order to locate Etta and the missing astrolabe with Ironwood travelers hot on their trail. They cross paths with a mercenary-for-hire, a cheeky girl named Li Min who quickly develops a flirtation with Sophia. But as the three of them attempt to evade their pursuers, Nicholas soon realizes that one of his companions may have ulterior motives.As Etta and Nicholas fight to make their way back to one another, from Imperial Russia to the Vatican catacombs, time is rapidly shifting and changing into something unrecognizable and might just run out on both of them.What I Liked:SPOILER-FREE REVIEW. (Unless you haven't read Passenger.)One-line summary: This book is every bit as fascinating, captivating, and thrilling as its predecessor, and a page-turning, satisfying conclusion to the series.I was extremely excited when I received this book early for review, but also wary. It's a long book (500+ pages), and the story is at an intense point (from the end of Passenger). I was nervous to read Wayfarer, because there are so many ways that this book could end, and most of them are bittersweet (or just plain cruel). I'm so happy to say that Wayfarer was incredibly engrossing and it ended rather perfectly - Bracken found a way.This book picks up a little after the end of Passenger. Nicholas and Etta have been separated in time and space. Etta wakes up as a captive of the Thorns, and she meets someone she never thought she'd know. She, Julian Ironwood, and the Thorns set out to secure the astrolabe from Cyrus Ironwood. Meanwhile, Nicholas and Sophia seek help from Rose Linden, only to be turned around several times. Looking for information, the pair accumulate a number of favors they must return. They meet Li Min, a mysterious and secretive traveler who helps them more than once. But Nicholas has one goal, and that is to find Etta. Sophia wants to find the astrolabe. And Li Min knows more than she is letting on.I'm still reeling a little, so bear with me as I go about this review. I've just finished the book and I'm in a pleasant state of shock, partial numbness, and total satisfaction. This book... I don't remember my exact expectations, before starting it. Hoping that Nicholas and Etta would survive and be together? In any case, I'm so pleased by what was written, and its delivery.One thing I do recommend is a reread of Passenger, or checking out some sort of spoiler-filled review or post. Bracken has a spoiler-y graphic available on her website. I wish I had reread Passenger, because besides the ending, I didn't remember a ton of specifics. The good thing was, as I continued to read Wayfarer, I realized that I didn't need to remember too many specifics, because more and more came back to me. At first though, not the case.One of the best parts of this book was the character development and introduction/development of new and smaller characters that had no or little role in Passenger. For example, I thought Sophia played a bigger role in this book - an enormous role. She is the most important &#34;secondary&#34; character (arguably a primary character? She doesn't have a narrative in the books though). I understood and liked Sophia so much more, in this book. She seems ruthless and blunt and sometimes harsh, but she is so determined and driven. She is someone you want on your side, because she is a dirty fighter.Julian Ironwood, Nicholas's half-brother, is another secondary character who quickly becomes very important in Wayfarer. He betrayed his grandfather and sought refuge with the Thorns, which is how he and Etta meet. When she wakes up, she tries to escape, and she runs into Julian. Julian is a coward and a runner, but we get to understand him better in this book. He is an idiot and a poor brother, but he learns this and matures a lot, over the course of this book.I enjoyed the presence of Li Min and Henry Hemlock. I won't say much on either of them, but both are vastly important in this book, and play critical roles in pivotal points in the story. I didn't love or hate Li Min, but I adored Henry Hemlock. His interactions with Etta were wonderful.Etta shows her fight and her tenacity in this book! She keeps moving, with grief, guilt, even pain weighing her down. She knows that Nicholas is out there, and she knows that the astrolabe must be found and taken out of the Ironwoods' grasp. Her goals are lofty but she never quits.The same can be said about Nicholas. He wants to find Etta and never stops hunting for information and leads. He and Sophia travel to so many different places and times, and make various (terrible) deals for information, to find Etta. Finding the astrolabe is important but to Nicholas, finding Etta is everything. Nicholas has such a pure and good heart, such upstanding morals. He's a good guy who considers everything, weighs everything, and questions everything. I liked seeing how his mind worked, and I liked seeing him push through pain and doubt.Etta and Nicholas are separated from much of the book, so I can't really say much about physical romance, but their relationship is strong through space and time. It's amazing how they never cease thinking about each other, hoping that the other is alright, and fighting for each other. They do interact at points toward the end of the book, I will say that.I died emotionally no fewer than seventeen times while reading this book. There were times when I actually teared up (my Goodreads statuses are proof). There were some painful parts in this book! Bracken took me on an emotional roller coaster. But for the better!I love the varying settings that Bracken takes us through! Between Etta and Nicholas, we are introduced to so many different times and places. The most interesting, in this book, was probably Carthage, 148 B.C. How intriguing!By the climax of the book, you'll be wondering how on earth Bracken can end this book with something happy or positive. There seems to be no way, with certain revelations about the astrolabe, and a darker force that is at play, and certain deals with devils that are very unfair. But Bracken made the ending worth all of the anguish and agony! I promise.What I Did Not Like:I don't really have much to say here, other than I do wish there had been more Nicholas/Etta interaction! I don't want to spoil anything, but the romantic in me would have loved more interactions. Of any kind.Not really a dislike, but I do recommend a Passenger reread, if that one isn't fresh. For example, I read Passenger over a year ago. A reread might have helped, at least initially. After a certain point in Wayfarer though, some things started to come back.Would I Recommend It:I highly recommend this book, and series! Time-traveling novels can be tricky, and very messy. I haven't read a ton of them, but one of my favorite series of all time happens to be a time-travel series - the Ruby Red trilogy by Kerstin Gier. I can safely add this Passenger duology to those ranks. This is a wonderful, fascinating, and imaginative series! With a very satisfying ending.Rating:4.5 stars. I'm still trying to decide if to round up or down. But rest assured, I loved this book, all 532 pages of it. It is worth the full spectrum of emotions that I experienced! I look forward to reading more from Bracken in the future.", date: "January 3, 2017Rating: 4 starsSource: Review copy sent by the publisherSummary (from Goodreads):All Etta Spencer wanted was to make her violin debut when she was thrust into a treacherous world where the struggle for power could alter history.

Now, robbed of the powerful object that was her only hope of saving her mother, Etta finds herself stranded once more, cut off from Nicholas-the eighteenth century privateer she loves-and her natural time.&#xA0;When Etta inadvertently stumbles into the heart of the Thorns, the renegade travelers who stole the astrolabe from her, she vows to finish what she started and destroy the astrolabe once and for all. Instead, she&apos;s blindsided by a bombshell revelation from their leader, Henry Hemlock: he is her father. Suddenly questioning everything she&apos;s been fighting for, Etta must choose a path, one that could transform her future.&#xA0;Still devastated by Etta&apos;s disappearance, Nicholas has enlisted the unlikely help of Sophia Ironwood and a cheeky mercenary-for-hire to track both her and the missing astrolabe down. But as the tremors of change to the timeline grow stronger and the stakes for recovering the astrolabe mount, they discover an ancient power far more frightening than the rival travelers currently locked in a battle for control. . . a power that threatens to eradicate the timeline altogether.From colonial Nassau to New York City, San Francisco to Roman Carthage, imperial Russia to the Vatican catacombs,&#xA0;New York Times&#xA0;#1 best-selling author Alexandra Bracken charts a gorgeously detailed, thrilling course through time in this stunning conclusion to the Passenger series.", amazon_link: "https://www.amazon.com/Wayfarer-Passenger-Alexandra-Bracken/dp/1484715764", kobo_link: "https://www.kobo.com/us/en/search?query=Wayfarer%20(Passenger)%20Alexandra%20Bracken", play_link: "https://play.google.com/store/search?c=books&hl=en&q=Wayfarer%20(Passenger)%20Alexandra%20Bracken" })
Review.create({ title: "An unforgettable, epic and amazing must-read sequel", rating: 5, body: "There arent enough words to describe just how amazing and incredible and epic a sequel WAYFARER is. It is action-packed. It is suspenseful It takes you to fascinating places and times. It will keep you guessing. It will keep you hoping. It will break your heart again and again. It will take you on an adventure and on an emotional roller coaster. And then it will blow your mind.Without the ability to travel through time, Etta Spencer and Nicholas Carter never would have met, gotten to know one another, fallen in love. Being a traveler wasnt inherently a bad thing. But there were risks. And there were often serious consequences. And over the centuries those with the ability to travel, intentionally or not, caused so much damage and destruction that reverting back to the original timeline seemed like the best solution to a growing problem.But the only way to do that would be to find the device that could make that happen. Again. This time without any clues as to who has it, where it is, or when it is. This time facing even more danger, confronting deadlier foes, working with an even more challenging timeframe. This time searching without each other.Twists and turns, secrets and betrayal, heartbreak and loss fill this story. Love and hope, strength and honor, bravery and sacrifice infuse its every page. The journeys are harrowing, nail-biting, tension-filled, heart-stopping. The love story is sweet, bittersweet, and so very romantic. The ending is unforgettable.What Alexandra Bracken did in this follow-up to an extraordinary first book in the series is outstanding. She delivers more beautifully-written passages, paints more stunning pictures with her words, invents more intriguing time-travel locations, introduces more interesting characters, reveals more about the travelers, the families, the past, offers more food for thought, creates more heart-wrenching moments.WAYFARER will fill you with wonder, bring tears to your eyes, and leave you desperately wishing your travels through time with these characters never had to end.Expect to be surprised. Expect to be transported. Expected to be riveted from start to finish. And expect to fall madly in love with this rich, gorgeous, and absolutely remarkable read.", user_id: user1.id, book_id: book31.id })

I can safely add this Passenger duology to those ranks. This is a wonderful, fascinating, and imaginative series! With a very satisfying ending.Rating:4.5 stars. I'm still trying to decide if to round up or down. But rest assured, I loved this book, all 532 pages of it. It is worth the full spectrum of emotions that I experienced! I look forward to reading more from Bracken in the future.", user_id: user2.id, book_id: book31.id })

Review.create({ title: "Strange and dark, with an intriguing premise that made me overlook its faults.", rating: 4, body: "Taking us into a bizarre world in which triplets battle to the death for a crown, Three Dark Crowns tells the story of Katharine, who is immune to poison, Arsinoe, a naturalist who can control plants and animals, and Mirabella, an elemental who can control the weather, fire, and water to name a few things. There are rules to the &#8220;battle&#8221;, and the triplets must wait until they are sixteen to start trying to kill their sisters, with the winner becoming queen.Raised apart from each other, and schooled in their specialties, the triplets don&#8217;t have a particular love for each other, as they were separated at an early age and are trained to kill in order to be queen.Out of the three sisters, Arsinoe probably was the most likeable; she seems carefree and down-to-earth and genuinely cares for her friends. Katherine was a bit too obsessed with learning how to seduce for me to really care for her (why must this be a lesson she needs to learn??). Although, I did love the fact that her favorite piece of &#8220;jewelry&#8221; was her very poisonous pet coral snake worn as a bracelet. And Mirabella, well, Mirabella was fine, she was probably the kindest of the sisters, and seems to be the one sister willing to try to not fight and instead be friends, but then she goes and has sex with a random guy (who of course isn&#8217;t random) on the beach after he washes ashore. It was just way too much of insta-love for me, and was flat-out irritating, and brought a weird love triangle into the mix that I just didn&#8217;t care about.With mention of the three different gifts (poison, naturalist, and elemental), there is also mention of &#8220;rare&#8221; gifts: the war gift and the sight gift.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user2.id, book_id: book32.id })

Review.create({ title: "Maybe I'm just not quite the right audience for this book", rating: 2, body: "I bought this book because of how much I enjoyed Blake's Anna Dressed in Blood and Girl of Nightmares.  I was curious what sort of high fantasy story she might tell.  I'm conflicted about writing this review because on the one hand I did not like this book.  But on the other hand, I think there are a lot of people who will love it.  So maybe my opinion on this one doesn't really matter.The book is the story of 3 sisters, triplets who were separated as children and raised by different magical/political factions.  Eventually the sisters will continue the land's mythic tradition of attempting to kill each other using their mystic powers (one can resist poison, one can control the elements, and one can bond with and control animals) and the survivor will be crowned queen.  The story moves from sister to sister with each chapter, describing the months leading up to the ceremony which marks the beginning of open war between them.I think the world Blake is striving to create is a dark fairy tale place, a world with strange rules aren't rational but are consistent within the confines of the story.  I think many readers will enjoy that element, swept up in the wild fantasy of it, but I was bothered by the fact that her world seems poorly thought out.  Though it gives the impression of a fairy tale place, it lacks the clarity and simplicity of fairy tales.  Blake tries to create a more complex and nuanced world, but she never steps back to give the reader a clear view of it, so we're left with something that feels cluttered and poorly thought out.  Concepts and rules pop up randomly when Blake needs a new plot device to knock the characters around with.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user13.id, book_id: book32.id })

It's extremely well written - the ghostwriter did an amazing job of capturing Simone's tough early life, her sweet and confident spirit, as well as her unflagging work ethic.  I liked how open Simone was about her early life (with Shannon) and how that shaped both her and her siblings' experiences growing up.  This is not a book for kids to read (unless they are older) - but I liked reading about this amazing athlete who inspires my girls in such a big way.  It's always wonderful to read the story behind the success - and I feel like this book gives you a really good idea of what Simone's life was like before the Olympics in an honest way - and even that Olympians at the top of their game can be subjected to harsh, unfounded criticism.  But even when bad things happened to Simone (like a coach calling her overweight in the middle of a competition) - she was able to rise above it and use it in a positive way to push her to the next level.  Although very few of us will ever achieve what Simone has - she shows that if you take your natural abilities and pair them with incredible dedication and sacrifice, big things are possible!

I knew exactly what was going to happen in this book. You know, too. These two crazy kids were going to fall in love, and it would change their lives forever. But the journey they take to get there... it's still awe inspiring.How does Nicola Yoon even do this? Because when I read the blurb for this book I was not impressed. However, having enjoyed Everything, Everything I took a chance on it. Boy, am I glad I did. I think The Sun is Also a Star exceeds its predecessor. Yoon has an amazing talent for telling beautiful, heartwarming stories using lovely prose that is in no way fussy or overworked.We follow the tale of Daniel and Natasha, two strangers who fate seems determined to push together. Daniel is the son of Korean immigrants who want him to go to Yale and become a doctor-- and they aren't really asking. Daniel does not want to displease his parents, but he is a natural poet who finds meaning in words rather than science. Natasha is the exact opposite. She doesn't even believe in love, much less love from first sight. Natasha's father is a failed actor, and the resentment she feels towards him has made her abandon any thought of have passion or dreams. The day Natasha and Daniel meet is a pivotal point for both of them. Daniel has an interview for Yale. Natasha is about to be deported. One day with someone can't possibly be enough to fall in love with them... right?Even though I gave this book 5 stars, and it deserved it, I still can't help but nitpick a little. There are a lot of perspective shifts in this book, some in first person and others in third, and sometimes that interrupted the flow of the story for me. I also thought the very ending was a bit reminiscent of Yoon's first book.If you're a fan of charming romances, pick this one up. You won't regret it.", user_id: user3.id, book_id: book34.id })

HEARTLESS is one of those stories that will be remembered and loved long after the final page has been turned. It is delightful and magical and fun and sweet and silly. And it is oh so very clever. And captivating. And devastating. And surprising.One would not expect the Queen of Hearts to be a sympathetic character, let alone a likable one. Yet Marissa Meyer made her into someone very likable. She gave her character hopes and dreams, even if they might have been unrealistic. She put her character into challenging and often no-win situations, forced her to make difficult decisions, and limited her possibilities. And she made her character's transformation from who she was to who she became very believable.Catherine was hopeful and foolish and emotional and passionate about the things she loved.

It gives you the famous quotes from Alice in wonderland like &#34;How is a raven like a writing desk&#34;, &#34;Off with its head&#34;, and &#34;I've believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast&#34; to name a few. But the entire story is completely different with just one small mention about Alice the rest of the story is about how the Queen of Hearts became who she is. And it is not a happy ending story. I don't think anyone is happy at the end of this story.Marissa Meyer describes everything so well that I believe that I am in Hearts myself. Or that I just have watched the movie Heartless because it was so vivid in my imagination because she describes everything so well.You also have all the normal characters of from Alice in Wonderland like the White Rabbit, The mad hatter, the Cheshire cat and the caterpillar. This story doesn't just so how the Queen of Hearts became the way she is but also how the Mad hatter became mad. There are scenes pulled out of Alice in Wonderland but are different to fit this book. Like the croquet with the hedgehogs and the flamingos.At the end of the story, you feel bad for all the characters even the loopy King of Hearts. Even though I know how it is going to end. That Catherine will become the Queen of Hearts, I find myself hoping and hoping that the ending would end differently. That Catherine will get her happy ending.

But when she encounters the mysterious Jest, the new court joker who seems to have appeared from nowhere, she's tempted by the thought of romance for the very first time . . .I discovered Marissa Meyer's series The Lunar Chronicles last year around this time and quickly became a huge fan. That series alone showcases her abilities to take familiar characters and transform them to fit original stories, and those abilities are not idle in Heartless. The writing is well-done, and she pays tribute to Lewis Carroll's Wonderland without stifling her own creativity. The characters are fresh and unique while at the same time drawing our mind to the original story. I almost prefer her version of Wonderland to Carroll's, mostly because the original story is a bit too nonsensical for my personal preference&#8212;Meyer was able to order enough of the chaos to create a story with solid structure, while leaving plenty of fantasy for the reader to enjoy. She mentions in the acknowledgements that she was inspired by Gregory Maguire's works, many of which I've read, and I must say I think she's taken his idea and improved upon it greatly.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user12.id, book_id: book35.id })

Review.create({ title: "Sweet Tomorrows", rating: 4, body: "Sweet Tomorrows is the fifth and final book in Macombers Rose Harbor series. Im usually a stickler and recommend that readers read a series in order. I stand by that advice but Ill admit (and its hard to) that Sweet Tomorrows can be read without having read the previous books. Macomber does an excellent job of filling in the details so that the reader wont feel lost. The series is a good one, so do go read the other books if you havent.Sweet Tomorrows opens where the previous book left off. Mark Taylor has abruptly left Cedar Cove. Even though he finally confessed his love for her before he left, Jo Marie Rose is unsure if hes coming back. Will Mark make it back? Will the couple finally find a happily ever after? The pages of this book will answer these questions for you and finish Mark and Jo Maries journey. While there were parts of this journey that bothered me, in the end Im happy with their story.Emily Gaffney is the newest guest at the Rose Harbor Inn. Like past guests of the inn, shes looking for something. But after two failed relationships romance isnt on her agenda. Readers of the series will enjoy a look back at some of the inns past guests as Jo Marie tells Emily the stories of healing that have taken place at the Rose Harbor Inn. Emily doesnt believe that the inn holds the healing powers that Jo Marie does. But despite that Emily does find healing  in the form of Nick. I enjoyed Emily and Nicks story but felt something was missing. It was a bit quick in my opinion. I wanted just a little more depth. An added bonus to Nick was Elvis, his German shepherd. I love when there are animals as characters in a books because they always add something special to books.Overall, I would recommend this conclusion to the series. The ending is satisfactory and each story is given a proper ending but I found myself wanting a little more. An epilogue perhaps that gave me that last glimpse into each of the characters lives?Thank you Random House and NetGalley for providing a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review.", user_id: user1.id, book_id: book37.id })
Review.create({ title: "Another emotional novel of healing that old and new fans are going to love (4.5 stars)", rating: 4, body: "The final installment in Debbie Macombers heartwarming Rose Harbor series, Sweet Tomorrows is another emotional novel of healing that old and new fans are going to love.Although it has been difficult, Jo Marie Rose has finally begun to move on in the months since she last saw Mark Taylor. Despite his declaration of love, he did not want her to wait around for his return from Iraq where he is attempting to save a good friend he was forced to leave behind several years ago. Having loved and lost her military husband years earlier, Jo Marie cannot bear to live with the uncertainty of whether or not Mark will safely return so, as he requested, she is moving on with her life. Finally ready to begin dating again, Jo Maries first foray into dating is rather lackluster but her dates with Greg Endsley are reminiscent of her relationship with her first husband. After receiving stunning news, her budding romance hangs in the balance as Jo Marie tries to decide whether or not to follow her heart in the midst of an uncertain future.A concurrent storyline revolves around Jo Maries newest guest, Emily Gaffney, who is starting over in Cedar Cove following the end of her engagement. Staying with Jo Marie long-term while house hunting, Emily finds her dream home only to have her hopes dashed when owner Nick Schwartz rudely tells her to stay off his property. Swearing off love after two broken engagements,  Emily is drawn to Nick who is dealing with emotional wounds of his own as he renovates the house he inherited from his grandmother.  While sympathetic to Nicks struggles with PTSD and panic attacks, she tries to extricate herself from their on again/off again friendship but Emily finds it difficult to stay away from him as she resists falling in love again.Written though multiple points of view, the chapters alternate back and forth from the key players perspectives and this provides readers with insight as they struggle to come to terms with their various issues. Although Jo Marie is trying to move on, she cannot help but worry about Mark and her fears about his safety are renewed after she receives an enigmatic message from him.  Emilys secret is heartbreaking and while she is certain she has found the perfect solution to avoid further pain, is her plan to avoid falling in love again realistic? Nick is unable to move on from a terrible tragedy and he remains mired in guilt and shame as he refuses to seek outside assistance in dealing with his PTSD and panic attacks.As with the previous novels in Rose Harbor series,Jo Maries B&B is a place where guests find peace and healing. Emily is skeptical of Jo Maries stories of visitors whose lives were irrevocably changed for the better during their stay.  Through Jo Maries conversations with Emily, longtime fans will be given the opportunity to catch up with the lives of characters from previous installments while newcomers to the series will be charmed by these heartfelt stories of love and reconciliation.Sweet Tomorrows is the perfect conclusion to the enchanting Rose Harbor series. Emily and Nicks story arc is quite endearing and with a multitude of obstacles in their path, their road to happily ever after is somewhat bumpy. Debbie Macomber masterfully keeps readers guessing how Jo Maries storyline will conclude and the resolution is absolutely breathtaking.An outstanding conclusion to this beloved series that can be read as a standalone (but I HIGHLY recommend the entire series).I received a complimentary copy for review.", user_id: user2.id, book_id: book37.id })

But its beautiful gothic exterior hides a horrific past: it was the scene of a series of depraved killings that have never been solved. Neglected, empty, and rumored to be cursed, it's known as the Murder House, and locals keep their distance. Detective Jenna Murphy used to consider herself a local, but she hasn't been back since she was a girl. Trying to escape her troubled past and rehabilitate a career on the rocks, the former New York City cop hardly expects her lush and wealthy surroundings to be a hotbed of grisly depravity. But when a Hollywood power broker and his mistress are found dead in the abandoned Murder House, the gruesome crime scene rivals anything Jenna experienced in Manhattan. And what at first seems like an open and shut case turns out to have as many shocking secrets as the Murder House itself, as Jenna quickly realizes that the mansion's history is much darker than even the town's most salacious gossips could have imagined. As more bodies surface, and the secret that Jenna has tried desperately to escape closes in on her, she must risk her own life to expose the truth--before the Murder House claims another victim.Full of the twists and turns that have made James Patterson the world's #1 bestselling writer, THE MURDER HOUSE is a chilling, page-turning story of murder, money, and revenge.

I'm tired of female protagonists getting tormented by fellow members of a police force. That plot tool has become incredibly tiresome. Aren't there other ways to create conflict and obstacles for a character to overcome besides total banishment? There were also too many obvious factors that the protagonist didn't see early enough in the plot and her inability to perceive them couldn't be excused by anything in her past.

Review.create({ title: "Apprentice in Death", rating: 5, body: "Its a race against time as Eve and her team track down a long-distance serial killer in Apprentice in Death. With no ties between the victims, no clues as to when or where the master-apprentice duo will strike next, and a vast number of potential targets in a city like New York, the tension is on high and Eve, Roarke, and company are running themselves ragged to take down the killer.The In Death series can be generally divided between character-centric stories and case-centric ones. Apprentice in Death is the latter, but even though my preference is for books with character growth, I ended up loving this case. It was fascinating to watch the pieces of the puzzle come together, and the more layers that were revealed about the stone-cold killers character the more my interested was piqued. The sheer number of potential victims weighs on Eve and her team heavily, and it also added a tenseness to the tale that kept me turning the pages of the book late into the night. Its a twisted tale, though not in the usual sense; the apprentice is somewhat reminiscent of an earlier In Death killer (and I cant reveal which character or the book theyre from without spoiling this story). Equally appealing is watching how Eves mind works as she makes the connections that will lead her to master and apprentice. While a number of faces old and new (Roarke in particular) are invaluable to solving this case, its Eve and the unique way she thinks that is the most fascinating to me.The In Death books can largely be read as standalones, and Apprentice in Death is no exception. That being said, if this is your first foray into the series the mystery will still be appealing, but the small, personal moments in the book might not hold the appeal they do to readers more invested in the characters. And fans of the series, fear not: there are enough personal moments in this book to satisfy and perhaps even tug on your heartstrings a bit.

From page 1 until the end I could not put the book down.  I loved the opening where everyone is chasing the chickens and especially the mystery of who was taking the shiny items.Ben and Sissy make the perfect to fall in love with and his family pitching in to help when Sissy breaks her leg reminds me of how family and neighbors help me other.If you want to know who keeps taking the pretty shiny things then you need to read the book.

Sissy sees the chickens and her customers also come out to help.Ben and Sissy have a long road to get to the relationship Ben wants to have.  Sissy is convinced of a lot of things that are left over from childhood.  I thinkall of us suffer from feeling of being not good enough but Sissy has that feeling deeply ingrained.  I loved these two characters and was cheering for them the whole book to get together.  Catherine Anderson never fails to deliver a wonderful book that is well written with people you just can't help falling in love with.  Her books are well written and the type of book you never want to lay down.  My first thought when I finished the book was WOW just WOW!

This is a fantastic book which should be unusual when it is the 27 th book in a series.  However, Fern Michaels has a way of making each book unique so that it stands on its own as well as works its way into the series.  In this book, the men and women work together to make amends for things that occurred in the past.Nikki Quinn is finishing up on a rather unique divorce case.  Something about it bothers her.  Neither of the couple seem to really want the divorce.  Amy, who has been hired to work for Nikki&#8217;s firm, and Jeffrey, son of Senator Buck Lambert, seemed to be really in love.  Amy is walking away with nothing at her request while Jeffrey is insisting on a trust being set up for her.  Amy agreed but didn&#8217;t intend to ever touch the trust.  As Jeffrey was leaving last, Buck Lambert burst into Nikki&#8217;s office to try to push his weight around to make sure Amy got nothing from Jeffrey.  Nikki lambasted him for bullying his way into her business and made it perfectly clear that he would get no information about the divorce from her.  As he blasted his way out of the office building, a little lady who was coming in was hurled in with the revolving door.  She had an appointment with Nikki.  In reality, she was the fashionable wife of Buck Lambert, Lavinia, who had come to Nikki to set up a divorce for herself.  She did have some definite instructions which would enable her to be long gone when Buck received the papers.  Something about her entire day bothered her.  She just couldn&#8217;t figure out what it was.

Whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse. August Pullman was born with a facial difference that, up until now, has prevented him from going to a mainstream school. Starting 5th grade at Beecher Prep, he wants nothing more than to be treated as an ordinary kid&mdash;but his new classmates can&rsquo;t get past Auggie&rsquo;s extraordinary face. WONDER, now a #1&#160;New York Times bestseller and included on the Texas Bluebonnet Award master list, begins from Auggie&rsquo;s point of view, but soon switches to include his classmates, his sister, her boyfriend, and others. These perspectives converge in a portrait of one community&rsquo;s struggle with empathy, compassion, and acceptance. Wonder is the best kids' book of the year, said Emily Bazelon, senior editor at Slate.com and author of Sticks and Stones: Defeating the Culture of Bullying and Rediscovering the Power of Character and Empathy. In a world where bullying among young people is an epidemic, this is a refreshing new narrative full of heart and hope. R.J. Palacio has called her debut novel &ldquo;a meditation on kindness&rdquo; &mdash;indeed, every reader will come away with a greater appreciation for the simple courage of friendship. Auggie is a hero to root for, a diamond in the rough who proves that you can&rsquo;t blend in when you were born to stand out.

There are so many small moments that struck me to the core - e.g. Auggie's feelings about Halloween, the way Auggie has an easier time when his classmates understand that there's more to him than his face, Auggie's struggle to move past his need for coddling, even the food that Auggie eats.  The most emotional moment for me came toward the end of the book when Auggie's father tells him that he loves the way Auggie looks, because that it exactly how my husband and I feel about our son.I wish that everyone would read this book, because it will help them understand the humanity of my son and everyone like him.", user_id: user8.id, book_id: book44.id })

Review.create({ title: "Every Child above the age of 9 should read this book!", rating: 5, body: "First - Parents need to know that Wonder is about young boy, August Pullman, who has a congenital facial abnormality who has to cope with a range of reactions to his unusual appearance.  Some kids use hateful language, and some people suggest that Auggie is mentally deficient.  However, goodness wins out, and readers should find it inspiring and uplifting. Author R.J. Palacio writes the book in multiple voices -- Auggie's, some of his friends', his sister's -- and the different points of view are mostly very well-realized and show the inner feelings of the different characters. Wonder by RJ Palacio was astonishing! I think the book was for grades fifth-eighth grade, and adults would like it.  This book can teach many different lessons. The one that stood out to me was not to judge by the way someone looked but by the inner character of that person.  It is one of the most moving books I have read in a long time, and I am still pretty amazed at how the author wove so much complexity into a story for middle schoolers.Take home messages included, you can count on your parents even if things get tough, sometimes people make mistakes and deserve second chances, sometimes you just have to suck it up and endure and most importantly, in general, things change over time.", user_id: user11.id, book_id: book44.id })

Review.create({ title: "Great, but with a caveat if you have a child with special needs", rating: 3, body: "For myself, I really enjoyed the story, and I hit several parts that made me tear up. It is very touching, and I think it should be an inspiration to kids to act with character and integrity, but it also lays out scenarios of good kids screwing up, and at times they apologize and others just get back on track.So why only three stars?  I am the mother of a teenage girl with developmental disabilities.  I bought the book because neighborhood children, that have included my daughter for years and been friendly to her in previous summers, have moved on and are no longer desiring her company. It was inevitable, but I wanted to help her see that others have difficult social situations and have a harder time fitting in and being accepted for who they are. The problem is that there are several references in the book to the fact that August doesn't have special needs.  When I read certain parts to my daughter, I felt like it was a further insult to her situation ... like if Auggie had special needs, than acceptance by the school and other kids would be a different matter, but since it is a craniofacial abnormality and not special needs, August should be accepted.It just &#34;rubbed salt in the wounds&#34; so to speak. And, I think the book could have been easily written without those references to &#34;Auggie not having special needs.&#34; It is pretty clear that he is a smart kid without these direct references.My summary is that it is an excellent book, but it may not be the best choice if you are trying to help your special needs child see that other kids have difficulty with acceptance too.", user_id: user15.id, book_id: book44.id })

Unfortunately, the only person who can broker a deal for the hammer's return is the gods' worst enemy, Loki--and the price he wants is very high.", amazon_link: "https://www.amazon.com/Magnus-Chase-Gods-Asgard-Hammer/dp/1423160924", kobo_link: "https://www.kobo.com/us/en/ebook/the-trials-of-apollo-book-one-the-hidden-oracle", play_link: "https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Rick_Riordan_The_Heroes_of_Olympus_Book_Four_The_H?id=SoxV9OyP0TcC" })

Review.create({ title: "Couldn't Put It Down!", rating: 5, body: "Read it in 3 hours flat this evening. Very well written, nice pacing, wonderful character development. Magnus and crew are very wonderful characters to care about during their trials, which makes the story very gripping to read. Unlike his previous series, the direction of the story flows much more smoothly, not having to worry about multiple viewpoints or flat main characters. There is a slight time reference discrepancy, but nothing that takes away from the flow of the story. It was a fantastic addition to a series that started off with a strong first book. Perhaps this is his best written series yet!Now a not complaint, but observation for parents.This series is much more violent than previous Percy Jackson/HoO novels, as the Norse/Heathen mythos is more outright violent than its Greek counterpart. It works well with the type of story Riordan tells, and gives more emotional investment in the plot, but make sure you want your preteen to read about decapitation/gore in such a way. As an adult it added stakes and layers to the story, and was wonderful, but I can see where some parents may be caught off guard by the brutality of some descriptions. Recommend personally for 14+ age range for the casual violent scenes.", user_id: user3.id, book_id: book45.id })

Review.create({ title: "A Little Bit More Outside the Box", rating: 5, body: "Cross-posted on Tween Book BlogWhy I picked it up: I like wise-cracking teens and Norse Gods. Especially together.Why I finished it: I mentioned in another review that Riordan's books seem formulaic; while this one isn't any different in terms of the formula department, Riordan has at least mixed it up a little for his readers by going a little bit more outside the box with his characters. They feel more rounded somehow, like even though they are involved in this supernatural world there is still the real world to contend with as well. The fluidity with which the real world relates to the supernatural seems much more urgent and apparent, perhaps because of the juxtaposition between Magnus and Sam. Magnus is dead, but can still cross over to the real world while Sam is still alive and can cross into the world of the dead. Sam still has family and school and everyday teen problems to deal with on top of whatever supernatural duties go along with being a Valkyrie, helping ground the reader even as we are rocketing among the Nine Worlds. Magnus's wit and sarcasm add a certain spin to the dire situations in which our characters seem to find themselves, keeping the reader eager for the sort of tongue-in-cheek style that has defined the protagonist. I think it's somewhat poignant that Riordan has introduced a gender fluid character to the cast - it shows he's keeping with the times and getting in touch with his audience. Really I think what I got most out of this volume is the idea that we might not be able to change where we came from, but we can define who we are in a way that is true to ourselves and how we want the world to see us. We don't all fit the labels that society wants to place on us - we need to be able to defend our identities and be comfortable in our own skins. We all need to have confidence in who we are and what we believe in, even if it might seem strange or hard to understand. And on the flip side, we need to be understanding and supportive of those around us, even if we don't always agree with their point of view - that's how I see it, in any case. It's a surprisingly fast read considering the book is a hefty 480 pages and I'm eager to see what new adventure and danger Magnus and his friends will face when the third book comes out in the fall.", user_id: user6.id, book_id: book45.id })

He can also talk to humans...if any of them are willing to listen! After a dramatic escape from a mysterious laboratory, Isaiah is separated from his mischief (which is the word for a mouse family), and has to use his special skills to survive in the dangerous outdoors, and hopefully find his missing family.

Ada Twist, Scientist, from powerhouse team Andrea Beaty and David Roberts, is a celebration of STEM, perseverance, and passion. &#160; Like her classmates, builder Iggy and inventor Rosie, scientist Ada, a character of color, has a boundless imagination and has always been hopelessly curious. Why are there pointy things stuck to a rose? Why are there hairs growing inside your nose? When her house fills with a horrific, toe-curling smell, Ada knows it&rsquo;s up to her to find the source. What would you do with a problem like this? Not afraid of failure, Ada embarks on a fact-finding mission and conducts scientific experiments, all in the name of discovery. But, this time, her experiments lead to even more stink and get her into trouble! &#160; Inspired by real-life makers such as Ada Lovelace and Marie Curie, Ada Twist, Scientist champions girl power and women scientists, and brings welcome diversity to picture books about girls in science. Touching on themes of never giving up and problem solving, Ada comes to learn that her questions might not always lead to answers, but rather to more questions. She may never find the source of the stink, but with a supportive family and the space to figure it out, she&rsquo;ll be able to feed her curiosity in the ways a young scientist should. &#160; Iggy Peck and Rosie Revere have earned their places among the most beloved children&rsquo;s characters, and they have inspired countless kids and adults to follow their dreams and passions. Now in her own charming and witty picture book, determined Ada Twist, with her boundless curiosity for science and love of the question &ldquo;Why?,&rdquo; is destined to join these two favorites.&#160; The book is the perfect tool to remind both young girls and women that they have the intelligence and perseverance to achieve their dreams.", amazon_link: "https://www.amazon.com/Ada-Twist-Scientist-Andrea-Beaty/dp/1419721372", kobo_link: "https://www.kobo.com/us/en/search?query=Ada%20Twist,%20Scientist%20Andrea%20Beaty", play_link: "https://play.google.com/store/books/details/Andrea_Beaty_Dorko_the_Magnificent?id=EEpTdXPVCxkC" })

While I am very fond of this series, previous installments missed opportunities to include a more diverse cast of characters. The author and illustrator work to correct that here with Ada and her family. Ada is a thoughtful, intelligent, black girl and aspiring scientist--something we need to see more often in picture books (and other books for children and teens).While Ada encounters some pitfalls on her way to becoming a scientists she remains curious and persistent. This story includes rhyming text that rolls trippingly off the tongue and cartoon-like illustrations filled with details to draw readers into the story.

I was very excited for this newest addition to Ms. Lila Greer's 2nd grade class because the principal character is a young minority girl and she loves science!  Unfortunately the book doesn't read as easily as Iggy Peck or Rosie Revere.  The story line is also pretty flat.  And while the things that caused insecurities for Iggy and Rosie were basically in not being accepted, Ada's passion has her being very messy - and writing all over the walls - and her parents are the ones that can't accept it.  In the end, her parents accept it but I didn't get the sense that there was teaching in that.  I'm all about accepting the curiosity and discovery and becoming a part of the love of research, but just think there's a better way to express that than a character writing all over the walls?  As with the previous books there are great illustrations and in the last page, you see the parents have gotten her a big long wheel of paper that she can write out to her heart's content so parents can show their kids, that writing on the wall to satisfy the curiousity isn't the BEST approach.All in all, it's got the notions of the previous awesome stories, but this one falls a bit short.

As the mom of a kid with autism, I really loved that Ada is a little bit different, and her parents have to adjust their parenting style and expectations to meet her needs. It's great for kids to see that sometimes parents have to make changes too.2) I love the emphasis on a curious mind and asking lots of questions. I think a lot of times kids are discouraged from really asking lots of WHY because it annoys adults. Curiosity is what leads to great discoveries. I love Ada's innovation in creating tools to test her scientific hypotheses.3) The style. Let's face it - these books are just oozing with style.

They think it's great that the reader has to say whatever the words say, and as long as the reader is comfortable being silly, this is a sure-fire hit!  We saw this book for the first time when the author, B.J. Novak (from The Office) read it to a group of children which we saw on Youtube. I was not sure the book would get the reaction it did on the video, but it was great! Again to my surprise, it gets laughs time after time. This is a great bonding book for adults with children, and a great way to teach them that books can be fun!", user_id: user1.id, book_id: book50.id })
Review.create({ title: "Great for kids of many ages!", rating: 5, body: "A huge hit with my 8-yr old niece and 5-yr old nephew. The only drawback is that kids will ask you to read it again...and again...and again...and again, and then some more.  My 2.5 yr old son also loves it and runs around the house reciting the lines from the book!  You can't go wrong with this as a gift.I read some of the negative comments and felt frustrated that many people didn't explain why they didn't like it.  So, here is why I LIKE the book:I believe that the main point of this book is to help kids understand that books don't have to have pictures to be fun, interesting, exciting and funny.  This is accomplished in a way that makes kids feel like they are the ones in control. And, we parents know all about kids wanting to feel like they are the ones in control, don't we?  Here is how books work. Everything the words say, the person reading the book HAS to say. No matter what.  This book is set up as an adult reading to a kid so... the kid feels like he/she is the one in control.  The book appeals to the logic of a child, which is what it should do - it's a children's book, and in a child's world, silliness is at the top of the charts. You can see the cranks turning in kids' heads when you read it, because they are trying to picture all of the silly things you're saying.  One last note is that I also see this book as a bridge to the kind of reading they'll do in the future: books with no pictures, where they will have to use their imaginations to make their own pictures in their heads.", user_id: user2.id, book_id: book50.id })

She was delighted by his exaggerated performance, which made us all even more engaged. What a feeling!!This book will &#34;grow&#34; with kids... this infant loved it on a very basic level as would any toddler. Five year olds will be a bit more clued in, and so on.

I was a little cautious because the negative reviews implied a number of lessons I did not necessarily want to provide my granddaughter.  Well, some of those reviewers either received a completely different book, or have some grudge against real life and positive messages.  The book is about a young, shy girl who makes her own gadgets out of junked items.  Yes, an Uncle laughs at her spray cheese can hat device to keep snakes away.  And, yes the uncle is a zoo keeper.  And, the uncle's laughter hurts her feelings and causes her to stop working on her inventions for a while.  But, the story is about bouncing back from disappointments and failures, not about a mythical perfect world where all Uncles are perfect and there are no zoos, and helicoptering parents are ever present to protect you.  So, an Aunt also laughs at Rosie's flying machine invention failure. And, Rosie is disappointed and decides to stop inventing. But, the Aunt's laughter is based on amazement, or enthusiasm, or perhaps just on seeing a spinning cheese spraying contraption try to fly.  The Aunt embraces Rosie and her failed machine and teaches her that failure is part of the process of succeeding.  So, this is good book that promotes a good lesson.  (I have to admit there seems to be a strong canned spray cheese component since that shows up in two &#34;inventions&#34;.

I'm also an English major who took multiple courses on reading plays of all kinds. So I am used to the set up and with amazing special effects could see this being entertaining to sit through just for nostalgia sake. However, it was bad. The plot was terrible. The characters were out of character by a lot... Doing things I didn't understand. It was insulting to read that something as silly as being embarrassed could turn Cedric into a death eater- his character was one of dignity, loyalty, and strength. To insinuate he could just have one embarrassing moment and end up being a death eater is unreal. Not to mention the giant plot hole of the time turner suddenly working in a way that he never has before (and in fact, was expressly written that it never could work in the way it does in Cursed Child). It read like a mediocre fan fiction written by someone who has only seen the movies. I was incredibly disappointed. If I was being more honest I would give this 1 star...

So even though I knew it was just a play script that J.K didn't write but liked it enough to let them put her name on it, I had to read it for myself.There is no way this should be officially thought of as the 8th story. She ended 7 fine and this just completely ruins that epilogue, she should never have let this be considered part of the HP universe. I went into this with low expectations and I was still a little disappointed. The characters don't act like they would if this were written by J.K. or any normal fan that know and love them as much as a lot of us do. The story skips over a bunch of things-i get it, it's a play... But the first few years at Hogwarts in the beginning were just a waste. You get to see some of the characters you love but others that you assume will be in it are completely ignored. I mean, the story has Hogwarts in it, where is Neville? Where is Hagrid? You're left completely in the dark about what has happened to a lot of these characters, not even a mention of them if they are alive or dead. The story itself is a bit ridiculous and is completely predictable. I won't give any spoilers but the whole thing is just one person after another whining about their daddy issues.Read this if you are curious and make your own decisions, but for me I wish I hadn't. I re-read 1-7 ever year (at least once a year, if not 2-3 times) unfortunately this book will sit on my shelf and never be read again. :-(", user_id: user6.id, book_id: book55.id })

So I was incredibly excited for the new one. I keep wondering if there's a therapy group where all the disgruntled fans can congragate and weep together. I'm also refusing to consider in cannon as it was not JKR herself who penned.  What they did to the INTEGRITY of these characters. I'm sick over it.  The entire 7 book series was about friendship, love and loyalty, and Harry knew that; and most importantly, knew that's what made him different from V. You're telling me, he, Ron and Herm  didn't continue to live and instil those values in their children? Rose was a bully, who was prejudice against someone without knowing them first.  Harry would never said he wished his kid wasn't his, or sacrificed his kid's only friendship over gosip. Harry wouldn't have choosen work over time with his family, which after all he'd been through WAS ALL HE EVER WANTED.If someone were to ask me, what is your favorite thing about Harry Potter?, I would hands down reply: Harry Potter's moral integrity, that is the heart of the series. It's his choosing to sacrifice himself for what is good. It's choosing friendship over suspicion. It's a defiant effort to turn towards the pain of loving and losing, then choosing not to love at all. It's choosing to do what right, and best for others even when it hurts, is inconvenient, or scary. It's fighting for truth and justice, even when you're the only one doing it.  And when you move away from those central themes, the integrity of who we know Harry (and friends) to have PROVEN himself to be, you destroy Harry Potter and all that he stood for for 7 books.  This new book is the worst kind of trash, the one that destroys the soul of our hero.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user8.id, book_id: book55.id })

You know the other child Ron and Hermione have.-  Lily and James Potter&#8230; MIA for most of the play. Like James? Was he even in it?-  Why was Ron running the joke shop? He is an Auror. WHAT HAPPENED TO GEORGE? WHY WASN&#8217;T HE RUNNING THE SHOP?!-  Let&#8217;s talk about Ron. Why was he so non-Ron like? His character, all jokes no supporting and listening to Harry and Hermione. Also he is hardly in the play.-  Harry&#8217;s relationship with Albus. Everything about this is upsetting.o  In the last book when they are dropping off the children at the Hogwarts express, the kids are genuinely confused as to why everyone is looking at them and Ron makes a joke saying &#8220;I&#8217;m famous&#8221;. It is deduced that the kids do not know the extent of everything their parents went through to save the world. Yet Albus feel the weight of his dad&#8217;s legacy. Huh.o  Then we have Harry SEPARATING Albus and Scorpious. Let&#8217;s go back to that epilogue where they all see Draco with his family and a joke gets made about not playing with his son. Which then Hermione corrects and Ron says to beat him on test but not to get too cozy and marry him. Again, making it seem that everything in the past is in the past. Then there is Harry&#8217;s history of friends at Hogwarts. He knows. He would not separate his son from his ONLY friend.-  Albus choosing Slytherin for a friend?

We pre-ordered the book during the Summer and it arrived the day of it's release. People don't notice the small stuff but I do.

I always love the smell of a new book but the smooth outside texture of the book adds a good feature to the book.The book has comic like pictures, but don't think it's a comic strip type book overall. It is a well worded book from the first page to the last page (217 pages overall) each page has a complete word filled page but the pictures adds to the imagination of the child reading this book. My son started reading this book series at 8. He's now 10 and he LOVES this book series so much he looks forward to the new books that come out and every once in a while re-reads the older book series. We even have family movie nights and I don't mind watching the couple movies that have been made from the &#34;Diary of A Whimpy Kid&#34; book series. I'm 32 and I find parts of the movie hillarious so I can only imagine reading this book as a kid. I can't say enough good things about this book or any other book from the series. If you're a parent like me, you'd rather watch your child read VS. Playing video games or watching TV programs. At least while reading it engages a child's imagination as well as improving their spelling. Some studies has shown that kids, especially those that are more visual learners,  spelling improves the more they read. :)I will be on the lookout for more books by this same Author  (Jeff Kinney). Don't hesitate to buy the book for your child (ren). I took a glimpse of a few pages already while my son is still at school and it's pretty funny! Ha ha ha.

My daughters are pre-teens, but have enjoyed many young adult books, so I made the decision to give this series a try too.We all loved the first book in the set and most of the second book. It wasn't quite as magical as Harry Potter in the sense that the focus of the magic and paranormal events is quite dark. The Harry Potter series is balanced with the benevolent and the beautiful. Attacks and battles happen in Harry Potter, but not in every other chapter as in Miss Peregrine's Children (as we've read so far.) Miss Peregrine's Peculiar Children series tends more toward the morbid and the mysterious, with lots of blood, attacks and bodies. Now my girls are going through a &#34;spooky stuff and bad guys&#34; phase (as a follow in from fairies and fashion) which is why I got this series, to be honest. They're quite happy to get all this inspiration for their drawings and games. But if you have children who are more sensitive, keep in mind that this series does include gore enough to cause nightmares and anxiety.Personally I have found the books too violent for my tastes. I was a little uneasy about this given I was reading the book to my girls, but it didn't seem to bother them. Now we're not a family who has a problem with profanity, but I think this series is a little heavy on it for pre-teen readers, and this is something I would have liked to have known beforehand. My girls thought the language was hilarious (possibly they thought their Mummy reading such words aloud was even more funny) and we haven't had any problems with them copying it or anything.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user16.id, book_id: book58.id })

There was a pretty big cliffhanger at the end of the fourth book and an even BIGGER one at the end of this one. I don't mind the occasional cliffhanger, but there needs to be some resolution. In this book it felt like we were just tying up lose ends from the last book, and then we were finally getting to the point we were before, and then boom, the book ended. Just as we were getting somewhere, all the progress stopped. I can't blame you for keeping us in suspense though! all in all, I enjoyed the book, but I JUST GET REALLY HUNG UP ON ENDINGS! They can really make it or break it for me.I also wish more characters from the last book could've been incorporated into this one. For instance, Arthur and Merlin were a big part of the last book! I felt like there should've been more than just half a chapter about them.I read really fast,( I also think the fifth book could've been longer! It did not feel like 439 pages!) so after that I finished the fifth book, I instantly went looking for the next one. I couldn't find anywhere that there's even going to be a sixth book! I really hope there's an update on it soon, because there wasn't even supposed to be a another book and I need at least a confirmation that there is one!I recommend reading this book if you have already read the rest of this series, but if you haven't you DEFINITELY need to go back and read the first four, or you will be REALLY confused. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because of the ending, but I still loved the book anyway and hope the sixth comes out soon!

In every chapter when you thought something was going well, the ship would sink and everything would be submerged and the story would be shaken. I really don't have that much to say about this book because I love it so much, but I do have one thing: most who read this book will love it as they've loved, in turn, the first, second, third, and fourth books in the series. There was also a HUGE, interesting, and unexpected twist that really shook up the story and increased the suspense and excitement levels by a tenfold.

I knew the gist of the story from the Batman cartoon movies, the video games, and other Batman-related stories and shows involving Oracle.  That's what made me want to read it.  I read Battle for the Cowl and other titles; all of them awesome.  I guess I was just expecting more from this story than girl gets shot, dad gets humiliated, batman finds the joker and beats him up, case closed.  Where was the Detective?  There was a little bit if that before the signal went up and he got an invitation, but that was it.  Where were the interim fights before getting to The Joker?  I was looking for a darker, longer, more complex story.  Also, I didn't get or like the joke at the end or the short story.  In my world, Batman and The Joker don't share a laugh.  It's...unnatural.

This edition also prints Bollands black and white story An Innocent Guy, now presented in color, as well as an introduction by Tim Sale, and an epilogue by Bolland.(For a side-by-side comparison of these two editions, go here: [...])#3  Batman Noir: the Killing Joke (2016).

Review.create({ title: "One Bad Day", rating: 3, body: "What does one say about Alan Moore and Brian Bollands THE KILLING JOKE that hasnt been said? Recently its come back under the comic-book-reading-publics scrutiny due to a certain recent internet crap-storm over a certain controversial comic-book cover relating to one of its key plot points. Ill get that out of the way by saying that the huffy indignation over the books extreme content is misplaced, as are shoe-horned dialogues over all-too-real social issues, and its relation to/depiction of real-life horrors. As to what happens to Barbara...I can see those associations, for sure, though that particular grimmest, ugliest interpretation is largely read-into-matters, with little if anything in the presented images and text to support the argument that thats what happened. If you keep up with this sort of thing, you know what I mean. The grim proceedings remain disturbing, though nowhere near as graphic or over-the-line as you might have been led to believe.Taken on its own terms as a work of storytelling, the problem with THE KILLING JOKE now isnt (mostly) in the work itself, but how in the years since, more importance and gravity have been thrown on its slender back than it was ever meant to hold. Someone reading it for the first time now, following its reputation, could easily be left going, Huh?As a brief 80s superhero/supervillain/psychological-horror comic, it holds up well, a graphic-novella, maybe the length of two individual issues. The story is simple but effective: The Joker makes it crueler and more personal than ever for Batman, Batgirl, and Gordon, in the name of proving the point of his deranged, nihilistic world view, intercut with flashbacks of the Jokers tragic origins (Christopher Nolan clearly yanked a lot of ideas straight from this, fleshed them out and refined them for his and Heath Ledgers take on the Joker in the film THE DARK KNIGHT). The artwork is holds up best of all -- stunning and haunting in places -- as harrowing and macabre. At the time, the presentation and the grim, extreme themes dealt with were groundbreaking for a mainstream comic, introducing a lot of ideas and approaches no one had seen before, revitalizing a getting-tired era. Compared to whats become common-place since, not to mention meatier, similarly acclaimed, groundbreaking works of the same day, its just not as fresh or shocking as it used to be. In some places, it now feels, if anything, a tad quaint.How the writing does/doesnt hold up: virtually everything to do with exploring the Jokers character-arc/outlook on life, and how his maniacal plan unfolds before the reader, remains pretty brilliant. Some of his wicked monologues belong in the audition-books of aspiring actors trying out for villain roles. Its the heroes side of things where it now feels thin, underdeveloped, and ultimately unconvincing. The un-fleshed-out briefness of the work is part of the problem, though really, this is a story where the bad guy is the true protagonist, who the author is clearly most fascinated by/invested in, and his hearts just nor really in it with the good guys. I dont for a minute buy Gordons demand of We have to show him that our way works! or Batmans final attempts to reason with the Joker. Even complaints of Barbara/Batgirl being reduced to a woman-in-refrigerator&#34; victim-plot-device (the one caveat Ill grant the recent detractors) might have been fixed were her traumatic experience and its aftermath given just a bit more breathing room. One senses Moore was hampered on this end both by length-restriction and DC editorial policies of the day regarding the handling of their most lucrative characters, so they come off a bit like morose self-parody...More would go on to explore some of these ideas with more freedom in WATCHMEN.So yeah, THE KILLING JOKE, still worth a read for Batman/Joker fans, to be sure, though whether youre picking it up for the first time or nostalgically revisiting it, I recommend subduing your expectations.", user_id: user3.id, book_id: book62.id })

Review.create({ title: "Quite possibly the most beautiful graphic novel Ive ever read. ALL THE STARS AND MOONS.", rating: 5, body: "**  Trigger warning for threats of rape. **They luxuriated sinfully in that most beautiful of all things: The written word.###All those stories you have told, all those wonderful storiesThey are nothing to OUR STORY. People will tell it in years to comeAnd they will say, that was a story about Love.And about two brave girls who wouldnt take s*** from anyone.###Lesson: Men are false. And they can get away with it.Also, dont murder your sister, even by accident. Sisters are important.###Once upon a time, thousands of years ago, in a land called Early Earth, there lived two star-crossed lovers: Cherry, a fair and lovely young woman from the Empire of Migdal Bavel, and her maid, Hero.Despite her vaguely masculine name, Hero was a young woman as well  and a servant and runaway, at that  both conditions which conspired against their love. Cherrys father insisted she marry a man who could provide for her; and so, after dodging his demands for one blissful summer (spent in the arms of Hero, of course), Cherry finally acquiesced. Luckily, Hero was able to accompany Cherry to the castle of her new husband, Jerome, where she stayed on as Cherrys maid  and her secret lover. Like many of the men in Migdal Bavel, Jerome was a rather dim-witted and arrogant misogynist, you see, so Hero and Cherry were able to outwit him with minimal effort.And then one day Jerome made a foolish bet with his friend Manfred, a man a little less stupid but a whole lot crueler than himself. If Manfred could seduce his obedient and faithful (*snort!*) wife Cherry, then Manfred would win Jeromes castle. If not, Manfreds castle would become Jeromes. Jerome would feign a business trip, giving Manfred a full one hundred days to execute his fiendish plot.Being an amateur eavesdropper, Hero overheard the mens conversation and tipped her lover off. Knowing that Manfred would take Cherrys maidenhood by force if necessary (read: rape), the women hatched their own plan to keep Manfred at bay: with stories. For Hero is a gifted and cunning storyteller who hails from a long line of gifted and cunning female storytellers.So for one hundred nights, Hero enthralls Manfred  and their guards, and indeed all of Migdal Bavel  with tales of madness, lust, deception, bravery, fealty, and ingenuity. Stories about sisters, fathers and daughters, kings and their subjects, men and women and moons and lovers. Stories of how the world came to be, and how it was corrupted: by a daughter named Kiddo and her father, the god Bird Man. But little does Hero know that her and Cherrys story will prove the most epic and revolutionary of them all.THE ONE HUNDRED NIGHTS OF HERO is simply breathtaking. Honestly, it just might be the most beautiful and moving graphic novel Ive ever read. I love fairy tell retellings, and were treated to several rather lovely ones, thanks to Hero. But THE ONE HUNDRED NIGHTS OF HERO is so much more than this: there are stories within stories within stories, and by the books end, they all converge in a way that feels both masterful and magical. Much like Hero, Isabel Greenberg has the gift of gab, as Manfred would say. She also has a sly and sometimes dark sense of humor, which adds a little feminist levity to a story that can be grim and depressing at times.The artwork is lovely, with bold graphics (that kind of brought to mind KILL BILL, if Im being honest) and punches of color to emphasize a point. It feels almost primitive, like the artwork of early h. sapiens  a few steps up from cave art, maybe. Rough and angular but also beautiful, in its own way. It fits well with the Early Earth setting.Hero and Cherrys love forms the heart of the story. In a society thats deeply homophobic and rooted in misogyny (some of the funniest/saddest moments involve women being persecuted and ultimately executed for reading, writing, witchcraft, and general sassiness), theres nothing worse than a smart and opinionated woman  except two smart and opinionated women who love each other, and have no need of men. Hero and Cherrys fate was sealed from the start; in a world where women just cant win, Jerome and Manfreds wager was a darned-if-you-do, darned-if-you-dont Catch-22 situation. (Think about ye ole swimming test for witches. Strip and bind a woman and toss her in the water. If she floats, shes a witch and must be executed. If she drowns, shes declared innocent. Um, thanks?)Yet their love  and the great love of The Sisterhood of Secret Storytellers, or The Sisterhood of Women Who Wont Take S*** from Anyone, or whatever you want to call it  endures. No, it does more than that: it transcends. It shines immortal, just like the three moons and the five dancing stones of Heros fairy tales.But the storys fist  the one that ultimately smashes the patriarchy of Migdal Bavel  lies in the power of storytelling. THE ONE HUNDRED NIGHTS OF HERO is nothing if not a love letter: to the tellers of stories, no matter what form they take (authors, poets, songwriters, painters, playwrights, sculptors, you name it!), and the adoring audiences who carry their tales with them, wherever they go, thus becoming storytellers in their own right. A well-crafted story has the power to inspire compassion and empathy; to topple the existing social order, challenge the victors version of history, and make the world a better place. Seeing yourself in a story is to see yourself, your very existence, validated; to see a different way of walking around in the world. The girls and women of Migdal Bavel? Of Little Rock, Arkansas and Chingola, Zambia and Jkabpils, Latvia? They need that. We all do.Some of my most cherished stories remind me of the one line in the one story I cherish above all others: the ghosts entreaty to Mary, upon her escape from the world of the dead, to Tell them stories. Storytelling is a nothing short of a superpower  and its one that Hero wields with grace and skill.Ditto: Isabel Greenberg. THE ONE HUNDRED NIGHTS OF HERO is a story that we need now more than ever; a story that Ill return to time and again in the next few years, and probably beyond. A story for the ages, as they say.** Full disclosure: I received a free copy of this book for review from the publisher. **", user_id: user2.id, book_id: book63.id })

While most of the film's incidents are in the book and much of the razor-sharp dialouge is reproduced directly from the page, the book actually has a far greater satiric edge than the film.  Whereas the film used the story as a celebration of nihilism, the book is far too self-aware to allow itself to truly celebrate anything.  As such, it becomes less a call to action and more a devastatingly real portrait of a society that has become so commercialized and codified that even the once primal act of revolution becomes just another submission to pop culture.Fight Club is the story of an unnamed narrator, an insomniac yuppie who spends his days helping insurance companies get out of having to pay their claims.  He wanders through a meaningless life until he discovers the emotional release of attending therapy groups for people suffering from various deadly (and rather embarressing) diseases -- all of which the narrator pretends to have.  When the arrival of another faker (the wonderfully dark Marla Singer, whose role is far less central in the book than in the film), the narrator finds even the shallow comfort of testicular cancer self-help groups has been taken away from him.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user2.id, book_id: book66.id })

I was even more excited to read the sequel to one of my favorite stories of all time. I'd heard nothing about it until a few weeks ago, which confused me a little bit. For the life of me I couldn't figure out why no one was talking about this book. Suffice it to say that when I got my copy I figured it out pretty quickly. Even as a fan of Fight Club, this was a painful story to read. I'm going to try to go as in-depth as I can, but first I need to get my emotional outburst out of the way:This book is garbage. Complete unadulterated crap. Avoid it at all costs if you enjoy a well written story that stands up to even light scrutiny. Avoid it if you are looking for a narrative that is engaging and easy to follow. Avoid it if you enjoy a plot that does not feel completely contrived.Avoid it if you were looking for a worthy sequel to Fight Club, and not an irreverent bastardization of its characters, plot, and ideas.Alright, now I can get down to brass tacks. Word of warning - I am going to be venturing into what some might call spoiler-y territory in this review. If that is turning you off from reading the rest of it this, I implore you to reconsider. This is one of the few cases where I believe having something spoiled for you is a better alternative to experiencing it. Help me potentially save you $20 and a lot of buyer's remorse.- The plot is almost impossible to follow. And it's not deep or thought provoking in a way that would excuse this, either - it's just poorly put together.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user8.id, book_id: book66.id })

It's a shame that Stewart had to draw the demise of Fight Club 2 at the same time. And Mack's work? Brilliant. Don't get me wrong, I couldn't put this down for the simple fact that mid-story Palahniuk had something great going.

Sebastian has to evoke and reunite with his subconscious psychopath to find out where his son is. BRILLIANT! But then...nothing. There's heavy kitschy references to the first novel/film to the point that it feels as though you're just re-reading/watching it all over again. Then Chuck is introduced as an ongoing &#34;writer's club god&#34; which is where the whole story falls flat. There's more panels dedicated to him talking to a gaggle of snotty writing mistresses on not knowing what direction to take than actual plot development. A cop out.

It's about a  culture of numbness, where Huxley, not Orwell, was right and the only way  to feel is to drive yourself to the limits of physical pain or destroy  something beautiful.

Raina Telgemeier has always been my daughters favorite author; she has all of Telgemeiers books, and even met her a few years ago.  Needless to say, my daughter has been looking forward to Ghosts for months.Ghosts is Telgemeiers newest graphic novel.  Teenage protagonist Cat is not very happy about having to move to the small town of Bahia de la Luna, but her little sister Maya has cystic fibrosis and the climate will help her breathe better.  Cat learns that the whole town is really into Dia de los Muertos; she thinks this is silly, but Maya really wants to meet a real ghost.There is a boy in the story, Cats friends tease her about Carlos liking her, but the focus is not on a romantic relationship.  Instead, there is an emphasis on friendship; Carlos shows Cat and Maya around the town, and he is the first one to tell them about the ghosts who live near the mission.It looks like this book might be categorized as scary, but its more poignant than anything else.  Maya has some health scares, and she is preoccupied with her own mortality; thats why she wants to meet a ghost.  Thats not something that Cat wants to think about, but she also worries about Maya.  I also appreciated that the girls try to connect with their Mexican heritage.Ghosts is a wonderful book.  I would recommend this book to just about anyone.  My daughter devoured this book in a matter of hours.  I read it as well, and Im always so impressed with what Telgemeier can do without using prose.

Many children with CF attend school regularly, participate in extracurricular activities, grow up, go to college, and have families of their own. I know several of them.

The charecters are determined and admirable, although I couldn't stand Bonnie.  A lot of people gave it a 1 star review because 2 of the boys are gay, and one boy thinks he's either gay or bi, but that made me like it more. It's different from other books where it's only straight couples and homosexuals are never mentioned. But this one showed that gay people are no different from straight people.

I pre-ordered 'Smile' with the anticipation of giving this to her as a gift. The book fell out of the shipping box, and I couldn't help but peruse its pages. It made me recall the days when I was subjected to the torments of wearing braces as a teenager. Upon skimming through the book, it was clear that this graphic novel was special. It beautifully captures that period in a teen's life when social-awkwardness and orthodontic-care collide, causing emotional and physical trauma.Telgemeier is a true talent, and confidently displays a skill with her artistic tools that I haven't seen since the heyday of For Better or for Worse. In fact, the author credits Lynn Johnston as an influence...It shows.There is a deft power to Telgemeier's narrative -- there are times when it's a little heartbreaking to read -- going to junior-high school can (at times) be hard. The author does not sugarcoat, and creates a satisfying world for her characters to exist in.I can't recommend 'Smile' enough.

Review.create({ title: "The best book in the series.", rating: 5, body: "I first read a BSC book when I was seven - in first grade - and the reading was too challenging for me, since I had just started reading chapter books.  Well, when I was eight or nine, I picked this up and read the whole thing without a problem.Now I'm fourteen and I still love the books.  They contain nothing inappropriate - no language, sexual content, violence, and only minor drug usage.  And when the rare BSC situation with drinking or smoking involved comes up, the character narrating the book clearly explains that it's a bad thing to do.  There's also a bit of racism, but no bad language or anything - just stuff like people avoiding blacks.  But this stuff is explained in the books to be wrong, too.So, there's nothing that will turn kids into bad people or make them know bad things.  The books are written in a great, flowing style, and each one is unique.  Sometimes big tragedies occur, but the girls support each other and pull through in the end.This book was definitely the best one in the series.  Though I only own about ten of the books, I've picked up most of the other ones from the library, so I can tell how good this is compared to the others.  Sure, they're great, but this one beats them out.It's narrated by character Kristy, who gets a great idea.  She and her friends Mary Anne and Claudia, plus Claudia's new friend Stacey, are going to start a baby-sitting club!  They encounter lots of trouble in this book, like pesky kids, people who want them to sit for dogs, and Kristy's worst nightmare......Watson Brewer, whom her mother is dating - and might even marry.  Kristy hates Watson and thinks his kids, Karen and Andrew, are probably brats, though she's never met them.

Review.create({ title: "Excellent graphic novel! Stays true to the original series.", rating: 5, body: "I loved the Baby-Sitters Club books as an 8 year old, and I am so glad to see them being published as graphic novels. I purchase two copies of this- one for myself and one for my 11 year old niece. We are starting to get into graphic novels as a way to help her dyslexic brother associate words and pictures. She was really excited to see a graphic novel for girls. I should clarify that these books are not *just* for girls- but they certainly appeal to my niece more than X-Men or traditional comics. Also, I should clarify that this book is not a comic- it is a graphic novel. This means that it is a genuine novel that has been heavily illustrated. Thus, if you consider comics low-brow literature, you may still want to consider a graphic novel. Essentially, the entire original story is here, with a lot of original dialogue. The storyline is the same and the characters are the same.There are a lot of graphic novels that I do not care for, because of the illustrations. This novel was illustrated by the same woman who illustrated &#34;Smile.&#34; The pictures and text are very clear.Some people are complaining the story lines are not appropriate for younger elementary. I think when these were published they were aimed at Middle School aged kids- since the kids in the books are all in 6th, 7th, and 8th grades.  I remember reading the original ones as a 9 year old, and it was my first introduction to a lot of new concepts, like divorce, deafness, and diabetes- but to be fair, these are all things I hear my elementary students at school talk to their friends about. Ann Martin has always been really good about writing about tough themes for kids in a way that makes them non-threatening.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user13.id, book_id: book71.id })
Review.create({ title: "Raina's great idea", rating: 5, body: "Let me tell you a little something about The Baby-Sitters Club.  When the series first came out in the 1980s I was like millions of other little girls around the country.  I wolfed those puppies down like they was popcorn.  Couldn't get enough of them.  Ann M. Martin (who later went on to garner herself a Newbery Honor or two) only intended to write four books (one for each club member) but popular demand was so strong that she started writing more and more and more.  If you were to walk into your local library you'd find dog-eared, yellowing, crumbling paperback editions.  The series has never been republished, so libraries are forced to hold onto the dying original copies with their lamentable late 80s/early 90s hair and fashion.  But do these covers deter the kiddies from reading them?  Hardly.  My library shelves literally cannot keep these puppies in stock.  Put a new one (which is to say, a donated one) on the shelf and VOOM!  It's gone the next day.Which is why the people at Scholastic are geniuses.  Right now I am holding in my hot little hands a brand-spanking new Baby-Sitters Club book.  It's the first book in the series and it has been utterly and completely graphic-novelized (is that a word?).  Scholastic has been veeery slowly cornering the market on high-quality literary graphic novels for children.  I'm not talking about superhero comics or manga or any of that run-of-the-mill material.  I'm talking about things like Jeff Smith's, Bone, done in full color twelve-episode editions.  Really high quality stuff.  Now they've given us The Baby-Sitter's Club in graphic novel form and the timing could not be better.  At this moment in time million of women who grew up with these books are now having children of their own.

Review.create({ title: "not as good as the regular Star Wars or Vader series", rating: 3, body: "As you know, Disney bought Marvel some time ago, and then Disney bought the Star Wars franchise as well, so it only makes sense that Marvel would return to publishing Star Wars comics.  I have to be honest, Ive been pleased with virtually every title Marvel has released belonging to the Star Wars universe, and Han Solo is no exception.This limited series takes place soon after the first destruction of the Death Star.  The premise is rather simple  Han takes on a mission given to him by Leia, whom he seemingly cant refuse.  He is to rescue some embedded Rebel spies posing as Imperial loyalists.  A famous space race is due to occur near the very planets he is to rescue Leias agents, and so Han will use the race as a cover for his real mission.  Theres only one problem  one of those supposed Alliance members is actually a traitor, but they dont know which one!Han Solo offers no backstory concerning the icon.  It does not touch upon the origin of his friendship with Chewbacca.  In other words, it steers very clear of any meaty topics the impending movie will likely address.However, thats not to say the book is a failure or boring.  Quite the opposite!  In fact, I think this book does a wonderful job establishing an important shift in Han.I just watched Episodes IV, V, and VI with my young daughters, and I noticed that Han went from being a snarky, selfish pirate to a loyal, selfless hero rather quickly.  Of course, those are movies and have to operate by a different standard of pacing, but when watched in succession its a bit jolting.This series showcases the struggle taking place within Han Solo.  He grapples throughout the book not only with doing the right thing, but also with introspection concerning why hes doing the right thing at all.  Best of all?  Like Huck Finn, Han has a habit of acting heroically when he doesnt have time to think.  There is a heart of gold under all that scruffiness, and this book makes a point to shine a spotlight upon it.Furthermore, we hear a lot in the movies about what a great pilot Han is.  This book takes that to heart while illustrating Hans skill on multiple occasions.  The race, called the Dragon Void, is designed to disable, even injure, the participants, and so Han must outrace, outthink, and outmaneuver his opponents, all while dealing with the Empire as well as a potential traitor on his own ship.But he does this with his usual swagger, charm, and aloofness.  Han Solo will never stand up front and center and declare himself a hero; he will typically do the right thing while self-deprecating and playing up an aspect of reluctance.  Because of this, the book helps bridge the gap between Han Solo of Star Wars and Han Solo of The Empire Strikes Back.  It hints at the good man into which Han will evolve.It also works to establish a bit more of Han and Leias relationship.  Neither of these two individuals are likely to throw themselves at someone, yet, honestly, the movies progress their relationship along at a pretty fast pace.  The book does an excellent job of inching their romance along, slowly, awkwardly, even confrontationally.  But, by storys end, there is a spark, an acknowledgement that an epic love story is about to begin.The art, by the way, is very good.  Mark Brooks has truly captured the characters likenesses from film without making them appear too rigid.  His spacecraft are fun while appearing consistent with established mythology and his aliens are varied and interesting.  Best of all, he conveys motion well, especially in regards to the race.  Its very important that comic book artists are able to literally move a story along from panel to panel, and Brooks manages to service Lius pacing well.If youre a Star Wars or Han Solo fan, this book will not disappoint.  I know on the surface it seems a little superficial with the clich&eacute;d race plot, but Liu offers some deeply interesting characterization and motivation for Han Solo that only enriches the character and grounds his actions in the films.", user_id: user3.id, book_id: book72.id })

However, while One Punch Man's premise can seem dull on the surface, ONE's brilliant writing and Yusuke's Murata's perfectionist drawing style, they simply make it work. As while Saitama himself can seem dull to watch fight, fighting isn't all he does. He struggles to pay the bills, rise up the ranks in the Hero association by doing good deeds and fighting monsters far below his level, and helps train the cyborg Genos to become as strong as him one day. Side characters keep the fights interesting, as they all have vibrant and original personas and attacks, but Saitama is where most of the dramatic tension comes from.One Punch Man Volume 10 is the 3rd volume to feature the new main villain Garo, the human monster, and is easily one of my favorites in the series already. This volume doesn't feature any action scenes featuring any main characters, but still keeps up the same intense pacing of all the others. ONE manages to humanize even the main antagonist, and delivers powerful messages about what real strength entails without being hamfisted or cheesy. Yusuke Murata's art is as vibrant and lively as ever, even in simple black and white images. The only gripe I have with Volume 10 is it's rather short, and the bonus chapters that develop side characters or the world of One Punch Man found in the end of each volume are a lot less interesting than the rest, but what is here is absolutely stunning.", user_id: user4.id, book_id: book73.id })

Nevertheless, it is really funny and action packed. This volume features a lot of Garo actually hunting heroes. You can think of it as filler I guess, but it's necessary in order to not run out of material.But this volume has 3 significant breaks in canon from the webcomic: allows Garo and Saitama to encounter one another before the big final battle, Saitama learns about the human monster threat and gets motivated to do something about it, Garo develops a rapport with a kid as he hunts heroes. That development with the kid is especially significant and I think it's an excellent addition. The passing encounter with Saitama is almost immediately ret conned and is just played for laughs, but it is there.", user_id: user16.id, book_id: book73.id })

Elias finds himself a bit perturbed; Chise is starting to make friends, a situation that he finds discomforting.  She does what amounts to a girls' day out with Alice, the alchemist Renfred's apprentice.  She learns Alice's story, which is an unsettling but hopeful one.  Then, around Christmas, Chise and Elias encounter Stella, a girl visiting the town who is trying to find her brother, who somehow got lost when they were playing.  It gets stranger when her parents tell her she's an only child and never had a brother.  What follows is a fine tale about the potentially high cost of saying nasty things to your relatives.  Certain supernatural entities just might take you too literally.  We also get to learn more about Hazel, the centaur delivery person, who's been a cameo figure up to now, but proves most engaging. This volume comes with a bonus booklet with a nice little story about Chise and Elias having a talk about things that scare them.

If you want the short version, this is amazing fiction with so many twists and turns you'll never see the big ones coming. I actually tweeted the author while I was reading, &#34;every time I think I know where this book is going, you pull the rug out!&#34; This results in an usually fast-paced story (at least for women's fiction) of a woman struggling to overcome the grief of losing her childhood sweetheart - who was meant to be her husband - and figure out who she is in the wake of such terrible tragedy. But the kicker is all may not be as it seems. Everything We Keep is also a bit of a mystery novel, and it's one particularly large looming question that keeps the characters and the readers guessing.Speaking of characters, Kerry's cast is incredibly well-developed and they feel like real people with virtues, weaknesses and plausible back story. She even made me fall in love with two men at the same time...which I knew wasn't going to end well for me! Add to that settings so vivid I want to pack up and live there and you've got an amazing story.I also want to say something about the epilogue because so many people have cited it as a reason for giving the book a low rating. No spoilers, don't worry. A) No matter what happens in the epilogue, that alone shouldn't be a reason to trash and book if you otherwise enjoyed it. B) This is the first book in a series, so you can't expect everything to be neatly tied up. C) Women's fiction is different from romance in that it doesn't require a happily ever after.

I&#8217;d be convinced that the outcome/reason behind a particular event would be one of two things just to be proven wrong.I liked all of the characters, but at the same time none were above suspicion. Ian for example: He is a photographer who sells his photos for large sums of money yet is willing to take a job at a coffee shop. Is he just a nice guy? Is he doing it for love? Or is he part of some bigger plan/conspiracy? Then there&#8217;s Thomas. Is he James&#8217; caring brother who is concerned about Aimee? Or has he something to hide?Is James really gone or is it an elaborate conspiracy? Why does everyone seem convinced that Lacy is lying about James and how many, if any, know what really happened?I really enjoyed this book and when I got to about the 50% mark, I wasn&#8217;t able to put it down. I did find the epilogue to be a little strange. I hope it was there in order to clarify earlier event(s) in the book and not to lead into a sequel.

Review.create({ title: "The Journey Begins in a brilliant way (Part 1 of 7)", rating: 5, body: "The beginning of an astonishingly epic story!!! While I was growing up, and I first heard about these books/movies, I was not allowed to watch or read them. But that all changed when I picked up a copy from a book fair back in 8th grade in the school library. Read it and have loved it. Loved it so much I had to continue with the other six entries in this series.So as everyone here knows the whole story about Harry Potter by now, we are about to get an eighth entry but set in the 19 years after the events of Deathly Hallows. And we are also getting another movie set in the Potter universe but taking place about 70 years before the events of Sorcerer's Stone.While living a life with his nasty aunt and uncle, young Harry's life is changed forever when he receives a letter from Hogwarts while being enrolled. Thanks to friendly half-giant Hagrid, Harry learns that he is famous because of his defeat of a Dark wizard named Lord Voldemort, who is revealed to have killed his parents.The amazing storytelling from Rowling brings to life something beyond imagination itself which has captured the hearts of many for several years.A great character example is Harry himself. Thus since he is probably the driving force for the whole story, he comes across several twists and turns in this and the six sequel stories that brings him to his ultimate destiny in episode 7. And with new friends and foes, Harry definitely is one we can relate to because at some point in our lives, we have been where he is when the story starts. And when he talks to the boa constrictor in chapter 2, I wanted to laugh when Dudley (his cousin fell into the pond) as the glass vanished.So this is the introduction to a whole other world within our own with Diagon Alley, Quidditch, muggles and so much more. It is an excellent way to introduce readers to this magical world.But another driving force throughout the whole series is that there is a whole slew of mysterious events in each individual entry. In this installment, Harry claims that his Potions teacher Professor Snape is after a magical relic called the Sorcerer's Stone. But as the story goes on it is revealed that the true villain (aside from Voldemort himself) is actually Professor Quirrell. Another thing I liked is while Voldemort is the true villain of the series as a whole, there are a few side characters in each entry who serve as the main villain individually. They either serve Voldemort directly or they serve the Ministry of Magic (in Book 5 more prominently).The last thing I like about this and the other books is that it is about development. As the series goes on, we follow Harry, Ron and Hermione as they mature in each story. In this one, they have already met (around chapter 6) and are ready for what awaits them.So thus begins the story of Harry Potter!!!", user_id: user1.id, book_id: book80.id })
Review.create({ title: "Reading groove", rating: 5, body: "The way that I work reviews of something that has been out for a very long time is that I basically give my opinion on it and if I like it or not. Because let's face it, when you have hundreds of other reviews you can easily get the information that you need from earlier reviews especially when it comes to something like a book that does not necessarily change unless the author decides to completely rewrite the book and that is not the case here.The reason I purchased this book, West try and get myself interested in reading again. I lost my interest in reading after grad school because I was averaging 50 books a semester I do believe. I chose Harry Potter because I have seen all of the movies but I have not read one of the books.  For me this is the beginning of getting back on track with reading, since I already know the movie and the plot behind it I am hoping that this will spark an interest for further reading for myself.So with that being said, if you are an adult having a hard time getting your reading groove back, maybe step back and read a book that may not be something that is your normal. Maybe read a book that your teenager has to read for high school or maybe even re-read a book that you read in high school and see if that sparks the interest of wanting to read.For now I have chose paperback, but eventually I want to get the whole set and hardcover because I do value actually having a book in my hands rather than reading a book on a screen.Harry Potter is a good place for me to start because there are so many adventures with in the series and the characters I will up seeing them grow on screen so I cannot wait to see how they grow with in the books and what may have been left out of the movies that when I'm reading I can go oh gosh where was that at? And I cannot wait for the new book to come out.Long and short my review is that a book like Harry Potter, you have to read with an open mind. I know sorcery and witchcraft will be a sore spot for some but reading ANY book with an open mind is encouraged. It opens our world to new things and more imagination. A chance to escape life through a book once in awhile is a good thing.And if you're wondering if this book restart my reading drought, it did help because the author has a wonderful way of putting us in a world that we went and think possible and if you pay close attention as the old saying goes there's always a moral to the story. I definitely will be buying the rest of the series to read. I ask that before you give me a not helpful vote, to consider what I said in the beginning of my review which is that with all of the other reviews that are on here would you really want to read another review listing the characters, the premise of the plot, and basically give away the storyline if you have never read this book? My review is solely based on my opinion about why it is important to read even if it is an adult reading A book to motivate them to read other books in the future and to be open-minded about what ever you read. Leave me a comment let me know what I need to improve on because it's hard to leave a review on something that you've seen the movie you've read the book and you know there are hundreds of reviews that all read the same way.

Review.create({ title: "Quick and pleasant read. Page-turning.", rating: 5, body: "I picked this book as my August Kindle First read. Without giving anything away, I will try to review the novel.The story is told through multiple POV chapters of characters living in a close-knit suburban town - some of whom have never left and others who have had to return after years of being away. The chapters are short, slowly building up the story from various perspectives, and effectively ease the reader into the underlying mystery of the town and leave you wanting to keep reading the book to find out exactly what is going on. The characters are 3-dimensional, and their chapters noticeably differ in tone and writing style. I have been disappointed with some of the Kindle First books I've selected in the past because the writing was too bland and predictable, and good writing is very important to me. This book was well-written, pleasant, and a nice quick read.", user_id: user3.id, book_id: book81.id })
Review.create({ title: "A Book I Wish Were Longer", rating: 5, body: "After a miserable experience with July's Kindle First selection, I was tempted to pass August by.  But the title of this book caught my attention, and it was as far removed from historical fiction--or in the last case, hysterical fiction--as I could find.Folks, this little book was a treasure, a journey sometimes pleasant, sometimes perilous, but always gripping, through a bucolic and almost too-good-to-be-true fictitious suburban enclave just outside the very real metropolis of Charlotte, NC.  I can attest to the landscape's atmosphere conjured in deft, often lyrical prose by the author--I've been there and seen that back in the day, and it's real enough.  Without trying, I believe you can actually smell the chlorine, hot asphalt, cut grass, and hear the sounds of kids at the pool, amplified by the concrete surround and the humid, breathless air.Besides the setting, which in the author's hands is a character on its own, we see this small world through the shifting viewpoints of children and adults.  Normally I'm not a fan of a multiplicity of such viewpoints from so many characters, but this time it worked for me.  I found the necessary distinction between the adult women, Jencey, Zell, and Bryte, and the adult men, Lance and Everett, for example; they each had a voice, and each had secrets that colored those voices.  Above all is Cailey, who sees more that summer than she wants to see and hears things she shouldnt, and tries to understand.  She speaks honestly, as a child, and not a miniature adult.  That is difficult to portray with skill, I think.I thought at first that the issue of secrets might mean this story would have something of the ominous thriller about it, but no.  Not all secrets are scary, and not all lies are harmful.  Yet there is enough here in the memories of the characters and in their intertwined lives during this particular early summer to keep the reader engaged.  Dont expect these short chapters that build towards a satisfying but in some ways unexpected conclusion to barrel along like a runaway train, leaving you exhausted in its wake.  Instead the chapters and their resident characters will tug you gently at first, and then more insistently, until you get where youre going.  I think you will truly enjoy the trip.And Cailey well, she is quite special.", user_id: user4.id, book_id: book81.id })

I love the quasi-equal relationship between Lady Emily and her lady' maid.The stories are told from Flo's point of view, which is a great way to have the action develop with her perspective.  She is a Welsh girl with little formal education who loves that her work with Lady Emily has broadened her life to include the globe, as well as a series of mysteries and adventures that often require her to use the martial arts she learned in China while her mistress was living there.The stories start around 1909, so there are cars and trains and primitive phone service.  The police are pleased to look to Lady Emily and Flo for help on cases where they need people both high and low in social standing to find out information.  Indeed, in the second book, the British Government re-instate the pair to help take down a sinister group that is seeking to control transportation in Bristol.Speaking of which, it is nice that the two books in the series are not set in London but in a small village, an hour away from Bristol.  The author makes good use of the more rural setting to provide interesting backdrops for her stories.The relationship between the two women is absolutely a hoot.

The year is 1908, and Lady Emily Hardcastle and her intrepid maid, Florence Armstrong, are looking to settle in to the nice, quiet, retired life after several years spent adventuring around the world.Naturally, such plans are always disrupted. In this case, the two women discover a dead body hanging from a tree while out on a morning walk. The death is meant to appear as a suicide, but certain inconsistencies seen to point more towards murder. With the local constabulary over their heads, Lady Hardcastle and Flo must draw on their previous experiences to solve the murder before anyone else gets hurt.The mystery goes off in fairly expected fashion, with the eccentric and kindly Lady Hardcastle relying on her witty and resourceful maid. There are suspicious characters and red herrings aplenty. And, naturally, the initial mystery gets wrapped up in several others in the course of the book.I will say this for A Quiet Life in the Country: it does not take itself too seriously. The usual tropes of the cozy mystery are addressed with a wink and a nudge (such as one character explaining to Lady Hardcastle that the tiny, 30 person village she just moved to is actually the murder capital of the country). I appreciate the effort made to acknowledge all the commonly used bits that go into a cozy murder mystery, and it certainly helped to dispel a feeling of deja vu.In all, if you&#8217;re looking for a nice, quick mystery with not one but two strong female leads, you could do far worse than to join Flo and Lady Hardcastle on their adventures.A free copy of this book was provided via Goodreads Givaways in exchange for an honest review.

Review.create({ title: "Agatha Christie travels aboard the Orient Express to visit Baghdad in 1928, a wonderful novel!", rating: 5, body: "The Woman on the Orient ExpressLindsay Jayne Ashford, takes us back to 1928, when thirty-eight year old Agatha Christie traveled under a pseudonym to Mesopotamia aboard the Orient Express.  For the first time in her life, Christie &#34;was traveling abroad on her own. Everything she would do in the next two months would be entirely of her own choosing. She would find out if she could do it. If she could stand being alone,&#34; and if she could finally banish the ghost of her ex-husband who had betrayed her in every possible way.The Orient Express, itself, connotes a time where passengers dressed for dinner, slept in luxurious compartments, and travelled undisturbed from Calais to Damascus.  Ashford captures the excitement and elegance of travel aboard this train starting with her depiction of the moment Christie decides to take this trip.  It was at a dinner party, one of the few that Christie attended as a newly single woman.  After learning that one of the guests, a military man, had been stationed in Iraq not far from a famous archeological dig, Christie exclaimed, &#34;I've always been fascinated by archaeology, I do envy you, living there. Id love to visit Baghdad. His response, &#34;Oh, you must go! You can get there by the Orient Express,&#34; had a &#34;magical effect&#34; on Christie and she told the guest that the Orient Express represented a pinnacle of elegance to her ever since  she &#34;had seen this train as a child, catching sight of the distinctive blue-and-gold livery when her mother took her to live in France before the war. She had watched men and women walking along the platform with rapturous faces, greeted by immaculate stewards standing to attention outside every carriage. She saw boxes of oysters glistening on ice, whole sides of bacon slung on hooks, and cartloads of every kind of fruit being loaded on board.&#34;Aboard the Orient Express, Christie learns that she is not the only one hiding secrets behind the luxury of the Wagons-Lits train cars.  A loner most of her life, she finds herself befriending two women whose friendship will change her life. It is through the eyes of these three friends that Ashford shows us parts of Middle East as it was in 1928, a time when Aleppo and Baghdad were busy, whole and cosmopolitan, and the Yezidis live peacefully on their mountain- Jebel Sinjar.As Christie cleverly demonstrated in her mystery novels, dark secrets can be harmful.  Ashford brings such dark secrets to light when Christie is called upon to solve real life mysteries involving her friends.  Never having solved a real life mystery before, Christie screws her courage to the sticking place and thinks, &#34;what would her little Belgian detective do in a situation like this? The answer came back in a flash. You must use the little gray cells.&#34;Through this fictionalized biography, Ashford paints a magnificent portrait of Christie as a woman of great depths, with a plethora of emotions and moods.  This is a novel that will engage both your heart and your little gray cells.(I received an advance review copy of this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.)", user_id: user3.id, book_id: book84.id })

While Kate must adjust to her new circumstances the book is really about the mysterious disappearance of her husband's Aunt Cecily many years ago. What happened to Cecily becomes the focus Kate's attention and that of the book. As a Kindle First book I have no complaints. It was what I expected for the most part from the description.

Glory is the center of her own world and she will not let anyone else take over. Glory can and will do anything to mold others to her reality. Glory's truth became her daughters truth and each of them learned to cope with the lies in their own dysfunctional way.This is a great story of love and lies.

Usually I struggle choosing between two books but this month I was drawn to the cover of Sisters, One, Two, Three by Nancy Star. Once I read the product description I was concerned that it would be too depressing however now that I've read it, while it's retrospective and there is a sense of melancholy it's so beautifully written and realistic that as the reader you feel mesmerised by the narrative and feel utterly compelled to understand the Tangle family.  This family has a tragic secret that no one will talk about, not uncommon for that period in time. Having resided on the idealism of Martha's Vineyard everything is kept private and quiet. The past affects the present and the story jumps back and forth between the two time periods to help give the reader context.This story is a drama about a dysfunctional family who's lives tailspin after a tragedy. It's primarily told through the life and memories of the eldest daughter, Ginger.  At times confronting, due to the inner turmoil you are waiting for things to unravel, and unravel they do.  There are many twists and emotions run high. This story is one of mothers, daughters and sisters and really proves that you can never escape your family.I love how the characters unfolded and enabled me to understand why they are the way they are.

When the facts in the case don't add up, the detective pushes to find the answers, against the pressure of the whole town.The story arc is well-drawn and satisfying, characters are multi-dimensional and interesting, as well as a tightly, but not tritely, tied up conclusion.

Review.create({ title: "On the fence", rating: 3, body: "I'm certainly not sorry I read the book - it's interesting, fast-paced, and entertaining. I love crime drama and this definitely read like an episode of csi or law & order. I also appreciated that the author manages to portray the heinous crime without being unreasonably graphic or vulgar. My biggest issue with the story is just how unbelievable it is. I realize Tracy's point is to uncover the egregious mishandling of the case, but it really pushes the level of possibility. The ending is also pretty far-fetched, but I understand it's fiction. My problem with the ending is how fast and explosive it is compared to the overall pacing of the book.Also, the author needs to work on names and naming conventions. There are so many minor characters and when they all have names like Finlay, Finn, and Kins, it's harder to tell them apart. Also, the author flips back and forth between calling a character by their first name and last name with no apparent pattern or reasoning. It makes it particularly difficult when a character is named something like &#34;Kelly Rosa&#34;, she comes up in about 3 scenes, and half the time she's called Kelly and half the time Rosa. I thought they were two different people.As I said, I'm not sorry I read the book and would recommend it to someone who was looking for a easy crime read. I'd also consider another book by this author, but agree with other reviewers that he needs to consider a different editor.", user_id: user3.id, book_id: book88.id })

Rachel is accused of being a bad mother, which she now begins to believe. After all, if she had kept Ben at her side rather than giving him a taste of freedom, this would not have occurred. She is forced to deal with her ex-husband's new wife, realizing that she has been unfair.When her sister drops a bombshell, Rachel feels that she can trust nobody. When Jim Clemo's girlfriend devastates him with her secret, he is shattered. Ultimately everyone surrounding Ben becomes suspect, and trust issues abound.This is a realistic page-turner.

It is an intimate look into their minds in the period preceding and following Ben's disappearance. Rachel addresses the reader directly, while Jim's account is in the form of his interviews with (and confidential reports to) his department psychologist.The characters are all described in great detail, along with their extensive back-stories. While not totally necessary, this does provide some depth to the story and makes us feel like we know them. The author may be setting the scene for a series of follow-up books featuring the same characters. The story itself is told in an interesting format, which includes narrative as well as blog posts, emails, interviews, and reports. During the investigation, we discover that everyone is hiding a secret - but who's hiding Ben? Everyone is a suspect: Rachel's sister Nicky, Rachel's ex-husband John, John's new wife Katrina, as well as anyone who had contact with Ben at school. Even the title of the book gives us the impression that Rachel may not be a reliable narrator. Could she herself be responsible for Ben's disappearance? I must admit that when I see a story like this on the news, I usually suspect the mother first.This is a suspenseful and exciting story, one that will keep you reading until the end, which is both realistic and satisfying. The story is followed by an interview with the author, reading group discussion questions, and a list of Gilly's ten favorite page turners.This is one not to be missed.I received this book in return for an honest review.Full blog post: [...]", user_id: user12.id, book_id: book91.id })

A little tomboyish from being raised by her father, Ember packs a punch when a stranger gets pushy with her in a bar, catching the steely blue eyes of a tall, gorgeous tattooed man&#x2014;Trace Montgomery. Still damaged from her last disastrous relationship and warned off the bad boy by friends, Ember fights the smoldering heat that Trace sparks in her when he begins shadowing her like a dark angel. Burdened by a lifetime of horror and heartbreak, amateur fighter Trace doesn&#x2019;t want to want Ember. His deep self-loathing keeps him from having any meaningful relationships, but Ember is an itch he can&#x2019;t scratch. The two push and pull, slowly crumbling their walls, seemingly brought together by fate, because the turmoil that haunts their pasts is interlinked in undeniable ways.

The ending is really amazing! Also, as another reviewer stated, the book cover doesn't do the story justice-so don't judge this book by its cover. The guy at least needs some amazing tats (which have meaning that is crucial to the entire story line). Maybe some MMA or boxing gear on?I do have to be honest with you, but let me preface it by saying that I always overlook reviews that only talk about the grammar mistakes-I've read those books and a few mistakes never bother me because I can tell what the book is trying to say. However, I'm going to have to mention all the misspelled words that run throughout the book. I know that can't be the author's fault, though. It had to be errors when the book was downloaded to e-book format? Anyway, the misspelled words messed with the flow of my reading and there were several times I had to go back over a paragraph to figure out what the sentence(s) were meant to say. I think someone needs to send out a revised version-it's really that bad-and I'm not one who is picky about mistakes. This was just plain annoying.I hate to end my review on a negative note because it really was a good book and the mistakes are fixable-just send out a revised book.

A young woman who sees herself as the shy type, happy to read her books and not gather too much attention who meets a strong, handsome, Alpha-male who seems to always be there when she needs rescuing.  He's rough, has a horrific past that he refuses to speak of and yet, he's always coming to somebody else's aid, helping others while thinking very badly about himself.  He's damaged.  No doubt about it.  But, she won't let go....he's it for her...and she for him.  This isn't just a love story with some hot, steemy scenes in it.  There's mystery, too.  A really good who done it is woven through the story.There's love, laughter, tears, pain, anger and hope.  I KNOW I'm going to read this book again.

To be honest though, I felt like I was completely duped and hoodwinked by all of the wonderful reviews of this book.  The only wonderful thing I can say about this book is that the title is decent, and the book ended--eventually.  I feel like I owe it to unsuspecting readers like me who are seeing 4 and 5 star reviews and expecting a 4-5 star book to tell you Run!

I had just finished Hopeless when I ventured into Beautifully Damaged.

Call Me Daddy is one of the edgiest books she has ever written and I enjoyed every minute of it!When 42 year old Nick Lynch comes to the rescue of 18 year old Laine, both their lives take an unexpected turn. Laine has been deprived of love and affection while Nick lost everyone he ever cared about years ago.They are immediately attracted to each other but their relationship is unorthodox. Together they can fulfill their desires without any prejudices; together they can be themselves and everything the other needs. Call it dirty or edgy, but to me this book read like a beautiful love story. Their age difference didn't discourage me and their story was at heart a love story that played with the cutting edge of roleplay and fantasy.Jade West knows her craft and if you love her writing, you will love this book as well. Daddy Nick will make you all fuzzy inside while at the same time you will wish he was real and not just a fictional hero.Expect extreme sensuality, passion and plenty of swoon worthy moments. On the other hand, if a heroine calling her partner Daddy freaks you out, then heed the author's warning and better take a rain check on this one.", user_id: user1.id, book_id: book93.id })

Review.create({ title: "Call Me Daddy", rating: 5, body: "Call me Daddy is definitely a taboo read. And, this book is not for everybody. Jade West puts a warning at the beginning of the book. She says Judge by the title. If you think this book is not for you, then you are probably right. If youre already wet at the prospect, then I hope you enjoy the ride. I think that Jade West may be the queen of the taboo.I enjoyed the ride.I will say that as I read Call Me Daddy I kept thinking this poor girl, Lane. But, not for what you may think. Lane didnt have anyone. Her mother left her home alone a lot. No dad involved. She was alone on her 18th birthday and she went out with her friend to celebrate. Her friend Kelly Anne left her abandoned with no purse, money or keys. No way to get home. I think that Lane was lucky to have found Nick. Nick takes care of Lane. Something she really has never had. He is quite a few years older than Lane is. Hence, Call Me Daddy.  Now if you are curious to find out what happens next you will have to read this book. But, be careful and read my first paragraph.

Review.create({ title: "Slow building thriller with excellent twists!", rating: 4, body: "This book is not one that instantaneously grabs you and doesnt let go. No, instead it slowly pulls you in until it has you right where it wants you. And then, BAM! Twists and turns galore. While its not a book where you are flying through the pages at warp speed, you are still slowly and methodically pulled in to this fascinatingly concocted novel. Told from two different times; Then and Now, you know that Charlie is dead but you have no idea how she died. Was she murdered? Did she simply vanish? And why is Grace so overwhelmed with guilt?Grace thinks she may be going crazy. Or is she? She feels like someone is constantly watching her and she swears she keeps seeing a red car behind her. In her grief stricken state after the devastating loss of her best friend Charlie, Grace isnt actually sure about anything. She is extremely innocent thinking and nave, yet I still found myself caring about her. There is a vulnerability and tenderness surrounding Grace that tugged at my heart strings. She has very childlike qualities, especially  in the scenes with her absolutely precious grandparents. Her boyfriend Dan, while so annoying to me, was very protective of Grace and I can see why. She has that air about her, as if shes always a bit of a damsel in distress, moments away from needing to be saved.Lexie is Charlies train wreck of a mother. My god how I loathed this woman throughout many parts of this book. Shes a cruel drunk, but although there were relatively few times I felt sympathy towards her, I admit I did. Her life hasnt been easy. Then there is Anna, Charlies long lost sister. From the minute she was introduced she gave me a single white female vibe. I mentioned Dan earlier, and I really wanted to like him. I cant. I dont wanna say much more about these characters as it would spoil the plot twists, however if youre anything like me you wont trust any of them for a second.The suspense in this book is a slow build up and I was playing guessing games the entire time that Graces life was torn apart and ruined. I made many incorrect guess along the way but that thrills me! Quite proud of myself for having things all figured out, then whoops totally wrong. Onto the next theory.If you like an intense psychological thriller, give this book a try.

The author has a writing style but unfortunately this book lacks originality along with a protagonist to root for. Everything that happens in this book you will see coming from a mile away there are no twists which is what compelled me to buy the book in the first place and there certainly are no thrills....unless finishing the book counts as a thrill.  Can we talk about the main character, Grace? The story begins with her reminiscing over her beloved best friend who has died and her trying to figure out the &#34;mystery&#34; her friend left behind. Sounds ok. However chapter after chapter is this Grace character moping over Charlie her best friend and she literally seems unable to function to the point that you wonder if they were lovers. It's extreme attachment issues or something. At some point you get sick of hearing about Charlie but you shouldnt because if she isnt thinking about Charlie she is anxious, tired, moody, scared and let's not forget sick....the character vomits about 800 times in this book! Of course I'm exaggerating, but only slightly. This miserable person, (Grave)despite her melancholy seems to be loved by everyone yet manages to always feel sorry for herself. I was tired of her by half of the book.  I continued on hoping to be thrilled but thrills never came. Near the end of the book I just couldn't stop rolling my eyes.

Grace connects with a young woman claiming to be Charlie's sister, but not everything is as it seems. Weird accidents begin happening and there's some weird events in both Grace and Charlie's past. The book switches between that past (chapters marked &#34;Then&#34;) and the present (&#34;Now&#34;), slowly revealing the story of the young women's tragic lives.I don't want to give away too much, but i will say that the book's main mystery is not the &#34;who,&#34; it's the &#34;why.&#34; And it's a great, twisted story.As much as I loved the book, it took a couple of chapters to get into it. But stick with it, it's worth it. Also, be prepared for lots of British slang.There's also some open-ended plot threads at the end that I'm hoping the author follows up on.

Review.create({ title: "Whimsical Seaside Mystery", rating: 4, body: "The second of Sayers' Wimsey/Vane mysteries, Have His Carcase never quite gripped me the way Strong Poison did. The earlier mystery placed Harriet Vane in jeopardy should Lord Peter prove unable to exonerate her. In this book there is no such risk-factor, consequently the story is little more than a mental exercise regimen for two not-so-old, not-so-dear friends (although they do get quite a bit better acquainted on this outing). The book is also a few chapters too long (or short, depending on your point of view); the evidence of the mannequin, for instance, made only a minor contribution to the denouement and could have been eliminated - or it could have been better capitalized upon and drawn in several of the women characters as suspects. The murder plot is definitely overcomplicated and would likely never occur in real life ... unless you wanted to commit a murder that would baffle the police and almost thwart Wimsey and Vane as well (in which case it's *exactly* what you'd do).For its several shortcomings, Carcase is still a very enjoyable read. The verbal sparring between Wimsey and Vane is priceless. Vane's perspective as a mystery novelist adds a bit of behind-the-scenes color. The local police force occasionally comes off a bit too indulgent of the amateur investigators, but it was very nice that they were portrayed as neither blustering know-it-alls nor no-nothing bumpkins. Bunter's quest through London involves some of the best written pacing I've ever read.A couple final points: The word carcase in the title would nowadays be written as carcass. Before reading the book I thought it had something to do with those large trunks that used to get strapped onto the back of cars.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user9.id, book_id: book96.id })

Review.create({ title: "Great book,  but read Strong Poison first", rating: 5, body: "All of Dorothy Sayers' mysteries are worth reading.  She has a command of English and a story-telling ability that makes her, in my opinion, one of the two greatest mystery writers of the twentieth century.  Most of Ms. Sayers' mysteries feature Lord Peter, second son of the Duke of Denver.  He is one of the most delightful characters in English literature and well worth meeting in any of Ms. Sayers books.  Most of the Lord Peter mysteries stand alone and can be read without worrying about sequence.  However four of the mysteries involve Harriet Vane, and for maximum enjoyment, those four mysteries should be read in order.  Strong Poison describes the first meeting between Harriet and Lord Peter.  Have His Carcase explores the relationship between the two of them as they investigate the death of a man whose body Harriet discovers while hiking along a deserted beach.  The interaction between the two of them can best be understood and appreciated if Strong Poison is read first.  Have His Carcase may be the least enjoyable of the four  romance-mysteries involving Harriet, but this book leads to the final two books in the series, and those two books are the finest romance-mysteries ever written.", user_id: user13.id, book_id: book96.id })

Review.create({ title: "A Classic in Cryptology", rating: 5, body: "I recommend this book primarily because it contains Lord Wimsey and Harriet's solution of a Playfair cipher.Most readers will recall Sherlock Holmes' solution of the Dancing Men cipher (recounted in Conan  Doyle's The Adventure of the Dancing Men) and Legrand's solution of Captain  Kidd's cipher (recounted in Poe's The Gold Bug).  Both of these are simple  substitution ciphers, easily broken if one knows certain facts about the  English language, such as the order of letter frequency (E, T, O, A, N . .  .)  The Playfair cipher, on the other hand, is an order of magnitude more  difficult to solve.  It is a digram cipher, using pairs of letters (there  are 26x26=676 possible digrams) instead of individual letters to encrypt  the message.  Tables of digram frequencies are of little use in decrypting  short messages.  Other methods are required.  The mechanics are explained  in the text.The Playfair cipher was used operationally in WWII and to  this day remains unsolvable as a one-time, short message, unknown-keyword  cipher, unless you can guess one of the plaintext words.  Wimsey and  Harriet were lucky that they were dealing with an amateur.Sayer's  audacious trump of Conan Doyle and Poe caught my attention.  The rest of  the book is, to put it mildly, well-plotted.

Birdie was born two months premature and has some mental issues that make her unpredictable. This is far too much responsibility for Tess but she does an admirable job keeping her sister near and safe from bullies who make fun of her. Unfortunately, Gertrude Klement the nosy next door neighbor wants the girls gone and does her best to report every wrongdoing to their mother. The family is going through difficult times due to the accidental death of the girl's father. Tess also feels guilty because she was present when this happened and she didn't do anything to help save her father.Tess is an interesting girl. She has many lists that she updates almost daily. Ways to Recognize Loony Behavior, Ways to be a Better Wife. They're all about her goals in the immediate or long-term life.

The problem with this book was that it had no stories, Rupi encapsulates you in an experience. I bought this to read to my significant other, I thought it may be just another pleasantry to share, but as I read it to her, I got so lost in the experience that I forgot that there was a person next to me. Feeling like it was an out-of-body type experience, I learned, and at the end of the day, I'll be a better father, son, brother, and lover because of it. So I thank the artist.

Review.create({ title: "A human eperience", rating: 5, body: "You are either going to love it or you're going to hate it.I read many reviews before deciding to purchase this book by  Many people said that it was clich&eacute; and it had already been done. Also a lot of other people said that the poems were too simplistic with not a lot of theme behind them.However I have never come across a book like this. I loved how it was split into four sections. Those four sections are titled The hurting, the loving, the breaking, the healing. And many ways I do see how people say that this is simplistic. But these themes basically come down to the human experience. Who has not hurt? Especially from childhood experiences that we may or may not realize molded who we are. Who has not loved? Who has not been hurt by that loving? And if you can get to it there is a healing process.I personally can relate to this book on so many different levels. I can relate to it based on family experiences, friendship's, intimate partners, and work associates.In a way and made me feel like rupi kaur was able to not bury these feelings like I have done for so long but actually put them into words and illustrations. I think that takes courage and probably a great amount of sacrifice. I only wish I could do something as simplistic as this that has so much meaning.Yes, it is a book of poems split into four sections. But those poems interweave and tell a story. What I really like about it is that you can kind of assume it's a memoir but you don't really know the true facts. It's almost like you have to fill it in for yourself. This is what I loved most about it because I could do that with my own experiences.It is not an expensive book and I was able to read it within one hour, and go back to it multiple times especially the section on the healing. It may be simple and not as sophisticated as intellectuals would like poetry to be however it made in effect on me and I do think it is worth reading.Can you give up one hour of your life to read this book with an open mind and realize how emotions and experiences truly shape who we are?I encourage you to read this book with an open mind and even purchase it for friends that you know are either struggling loving hurting or healing. And isn't that everyone? Can't you see how everyone is experiencing one of these things right now?It hit me so deeply that it is actually helping me on my own healing knowing that I am not alone. And that is ONE of the greatest human sufferings-loneliness. whenever I feel lonely I picked up this book and read it to remind myself that there are others out there suffering much more than I am and it gives me a great sense of gratitude.", user_id: user5.id, book_id: book102.id })

(not to mention the first color pages of the book gives us another look at what doppel truly is, as a species)And yes, while fanservice and male sexual fantasy are major components of this story in general (and as stated in another review, is on the lighter side this volume) there is more to monster musume then -just- that.

For the man is her neighbor Lee Jacobs, and he is dead. Stabbed with a knife. And she has no memory of what, if anything, went on between her and Lee. Plus, there is not a drop of blood on her.Thus begins the twisted tale that only gets more complex as time goes by. First, Tara decides to say nothing, hoping that the police will find whoever killed Lee. For she is sure that she didn&#8217;t.

It might have been Lee&#8217;s wife Serena. They had been having trouble.Or perhaps it could have been Tara and Noah&#8217;s daughter Rosie, who has been behaving oddly. Even more so than usual, and she finally &#8220;confessed&#8221; that Lee had been hitting on her, but denied that anything had happened. However, when someone lies as much as Rosie does, it&#8217;s hard to believe anything she says. Then, from one moment to the next, Rosie&#8217;s story changes. She is also very horrible to her mother most of the time, so it would be easy to believe she had done something this despicable.At one point, Mikey, a coworker of Tara&#8217;s, appears to be stalking her, and pushing for a relationship.

As a longtime fan of historically-based novels, I found Palm Trees full of passion and struggle and warmth. Having a linguistics lecturer as a main character added good depth and the mysterious letter at the beginning was a good hook. There are two reasons I give it four stars instead of five.1. Too many minor characters are spread way too thin. Too many people (Regina, Nelson, Boseupo, and others) are mentioned early in the book and then not again for 300 or 400 pages. Too many characters diluted the main story.2. The romance aspect of the novel was overdone for my tastes: Both had been with others, but they had never entrusted their souls to anyone. Now they did.

It is both a poignant and painful read. The inhumane and bigoted parts are difficult to read. The love and respect that grew among others gave you hope. The hardest part was even after Spain backed a democracy the new rulers were brutal toward smaller tribes and factions within their own country. It seems we never learn that war and hatred of people with different view points is wrong. The love story imbedded within all of the political intrigue was beautiful but sad and the discoveries made by the children were deeply moving.

book120 = Book.create({ title: "Girl JackedAuthor: Christopher GreysonGenre: mysteryReview:Girl Jacked, written by, revolved around a policeman named Jack. After discovering that the sister of his best friend from high school had gone missing, he is determined to take this case into his own hands. However, before he knows it, the mystery of the death of the missing girl has gotten him into a web of entangled lies and malice.I liked the main character, Jack, a lot.  There’s really no reason not to like him.  He’s tough, he’s smart, determined and has a strong sense of ethics. However, he also experienced flashbacks of his time serving in the military. I found them to be insightul and help paint a better picture of his character. Also, I think the author did an excellent job of summing up Jack;s early years as a child in the scene in which Jack explains why he named himself Jack. Over all, Jack was a solidly built character.Replacement (the name of the missing girl’s sister), on the other hand, was more of a wild card. Replacement’s real name is Alice, but everyone calls her Replacement, so that is the name I will use.  She approaches Jack, seeking help to solve her missing sister’s case.  Even though she’s supposed to be a young adult (early twenties?), she often acts like a twelve-year old.  I got frustrated with her when she purposely disobeys Jack and ends up getting in trouble.  I mean, I would’ve understood it if she ignored his orders once or twice, but the fact that she repeatedly took the opposite course of action of what Jack advised kind of annoyed me.  Why should she seek help from Jack if she wasn’t going to listen to him?At the beginning, the plot seemed like a simple missing-person mystery. However, 33% into the book, readers quickly discover that the missing-person case has turned into a murder mystery.  In short, what seemed like a basic story line actually unfolds into a more complex tale, which I enjoyed.The writing overall was good and very readable. The sentences were crisp and to the point, which I think suited the genre very well.  The pacing was excellent as well; there wasn’t a slow part in the book at all.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading mysteries.***a free copy was given in return for an honest review***", author: "", image_url: "https://res.cloudinary.com/dt72mzjpx/image/upload/book_120.jpg", publisher: "Greyson Media Mystery Books Series; 2 edition ", date: "July 17, 2014", description: " This top-rated mystery-thriller series is on sale for a limited time to introduce you to the wildly popular Detective Jack Stratton Series from Wall Street Journal bestselling author Christopher Greyson.

Review.create({ title: "A Simple Case that turns Complex", rating: 4, body: "Title: Girl JackedAuthor: Christopher GreysonGenre: mysteryReview:Girl Jacked, written by, revolved around a policeman named Jack. After discovering that the sister of his best friend from high school had gone missing, he is determined to take this case into his own hands. However, before he knows it, the mystery of the death of the missing girl has gotten him into a web of entangled lies and malice.I liked the main character, Jack, a lot.  Theres really no reason not to like him.  Hes tough, hes smart, determined and has a strong sense of ethics. However, he also experienced flashbacks of his time serving in the military. I found them to be insightul and help paint a better picture of his character. Also, I think the author did an excellent job of summing up Jack;s early years as a child in the scene in which Jack explains why he named himself Jack. Over all, Jack was a solidly built character.Replacement (the name of the missing girls sister), on the other hand, was more of a wild card. Replacements real name is Alice, but everyone calls her Replacement, so that is the name I will use.  She approaches Jack, seeking help to solve her missing sisters case.  Even though shes supposed to be a young adult (early twenties?), she often acts like a twelve-year old.  I got frustrated with her when she purposely disobeys Jack and ends up getting in trouble.  I mean, I wouldve understood it if she ignored his orders once or twice, but the fact that she repeatedly took the opposite course of action of what Jack advised kind of annoyed me.  Why should she seek help from Jack if she wasnt going to listen to him?At the beginning, the plot seemed like a simple missing-person mystery. However, 33% into the book, readers quickly discover that the missing-person case has turned into a murder mystery.  In short, what seemed like a basic story line actually unfolds into a more complex tale, which I enjoyed.The writing overall was good and very readable. The sentences were crisp and to the point, which I think suited the genre very well.

Review.create({ title: "A great mystery with interesting characters", rating: 5, body: "Jack Stratton is a cop. We first meet him on a night shift where he single-handedly 'calms down' three drunken lumberjacks who were causing trouble in a bar. After a stressful night he returns to his apartment only to find a naked girl in the shower and a very pissed off girlfriend. The naked girl turns out to be his foster sister whom he hadn't seen for many years. She tells him that his best friend's sister has disappeared and he's the only person who can help find her.That's how the story begins and it only gets better from there.This was a great book. A mystery that gets more and more complicated, interesting characters and great humor. I found myself laughing out loud quite a lot and I rarely do that when reading a book. I think that humor helped balance out the darker parts of the story which made the book even better.I'm looking forward to other mysteries that Jack and Replacement solve together.", user_id: user4.id, book_id: book120.id })

These are the pages from the Dwarven book found in the Mines of Moria by Gandalf and the Fellowship.  In the begining and ending of the book are also included maps that fold out to render Middle-earth for the reader, again as the author originally wanted.This is the book that Tolkien dreamed of having published but couldn't due to the realities of post-WWII publishing costs and questions about a 400,000 word publication.For me, there is an emtoional response to this book for two reasons.  One, it is as fine or better than the book the author originally wished to have published and two, it is a beautiful piece of art all on its own, suitable for display.  If you love books or love Tolkien or both, this is a must have and the centerpiece of any worthy collection.(Some are commenting that the book isn't actually leather.

The type is nice and clear, very easy to read. (Many cheaper editions are also rather hard on the eyes. Check the print before you buy, folks!)The illustrations are printed very clearly, and with very good notes on what they are.And then the annotations - useful, engaging, and very well done. You will WANT to read these. We discover how the book was written, and what was changed between editions. (There were many changes made so that The Hobbit would conform more easily to the Lord of the Rings trilogy.) There are fascinating tidbits about Tolkien's life and the experiences that made their way into the story.The forward tells about the writing of the novel, and the appedices give additional details about the text.There are also many illustrations from other editions of the book. These are varied, from thought-provoking to not-provoking.And the book is not too big. Some editions are simply too big to be read, but this book is reasonably sized so that you can actually READ IT!

Rowling is absolutely brilliant at creating wonderful characters and placing them in a magical world where, despite its dangers, I would love to live.That's not to say that PHOENIX doesn't have issues. All of the later POTTER books went on too long and desperately needed more editing. I expect this was the result of their huge popularity and the publisher trying to get them out as quickly as possible. Not that I was bored. I wasn't. But... [SPOILER ALERT! DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IN THE BOOK. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!] ...after the final battle at the Ministry with Voldemort, and after Sirius has been killed, the story needed to be wrapped up quickly. Yes, we needed to hear what Dumbledore had to say to Harry, but after that, Rowling should have quickly set up the next installment and ended it.There were also some literary missteps in this one (at least in my opinion): Umbridge would have NEVER followed Harry and Hermione into the Forbidden Forest. She was far too suspicious by nature. Harry took far too long to rescue Sirius. Of course we later find out it was a setup and Sirius wasn't really in danger (initially), but the unreality of this drew me out of the story. Rowling tried to cushion it by constantly referring to the fact that Harry's scar wasn't hurting him enough to think Sirius was already dead, but this never worked for me. I kept saying to myself, &#34;Voldemort would have killed Sirius by now. He's never hesitated to kill anyone else.&#34; I also felt the final battle at the Ministry as Rowling described it was unbelievable.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user2.id, book_id: book122.id })

We didn't start buying these for our collection until book #5 when the series had gained such a huge following. We were so glad we could find these individually here on Amazon to get the missing ones.The Prisoner of Azkaban continues a fascinating and engaging series. Book one of the series was very lighthearted as the world and characters were introduced. There was indeed a conflict and a villain, but the focus was on the world itself and the magic we could find in it. Book two continued in that world but had a noticeably darker tone (as did many of the later books). However, Book three returned us to a lighter tone while creating a self-encased conflict and villain with some really neat time-travelling plot twists (think of Bill and Ted or Back to the Future). The last four books tell more of a continuous narrative while I feel that each of the first three is more standalone. Yes, they end with an explanation of how the self-contained events fit into the overarching conflict of the series. But the individual plot elements of the books seem to lend themselves to the story at hand rather than the overall conflict. It seems that this changes with Book four when many parts of the book focus more on the overall plot rather than the individual book plot.Even if you've seen the movies, the books are deserving of a read. The cliche that the books are always better than the movies holds very true here.

Do I write my review based upon my first time reading it, or the everlasting impression this book has left me with? I think that fact that this book has made me think and ponder certain ideas over the years, I think the everlasting impression should be the topic of my review.After encountering Dolores Umbridge, I was left pondering the question &#34;What is evil?&#34; Voldemort is obviously the Villian of the series, however I feel Umbridge is a much more sinister and evil Villian than even Voldemort. Voldemort's actions and evil deeds are really very simple to understand. What motivates him is power and greed and he is willing to go to any lengths to achieve those goals. While evil in itself, his motives and actions are very straight forward and easy to understand. It is easy to see Voldemort for the evil that he is, which therefore keeps him in hiding only surrounded by his Death Eaters. Dolores Umbridge is a very different type of evil. Dolores Umbridge is the type of evil that we, the muggles that we are, encounter on a daily basis. They are the people who enjoy the hurt, pain, chaos and distrust they cause through their manipulations and lies.

I was going to read a few pages from each book and see which grabbed my attention.  I started with this book and just kept reading.It was well written and well edited.  Witty humor was interjected throughout, and while centered around a deep subject, the book was light and yes, maybe a bit fluffy. I felt that the main characters were well developed and part of what kept me hooked was that I cared about Libby and wanted to see what happened to her.  I appreciate that this was a &#34;clean&#34; book - no swearing, no explicit sex scenes, but I would have liked Libby's first love scene to have been slightly more detailed.  At only a sentence or two long, at first I wasn't sure if it was something that had actually happened.I disagree with what one reviewer said about everything being neatly tied up in a bow at the end.

Review.create({ title: "Not the best, not the worst", rating: 3, body: "This is a fluffy read about a women who's diagnosed with cancer and decides to go have one last hurrah before dying. Other reviewers have covered the plotline pretty well. The plot itself isn't bad, but I get annoyed when authors make mistakes in the details of their story. Some examples:1. When Libby first arrives in Vieques, her luggage is left on the plane while she drives to her beach cottage. At the beach cottage, she suddenly now has her luggage in the car, but is too tired to take it inside so she leaves it there. Then a few pages later, the pilot shows up with her luggage.2. Libby and Shiloh go kayaking, which Libby is worried about because she's not athletic. Shiloh hands Libby a kayak, proving to me that obviously the author has never had anything to do with kayaks. How do you &#34;hand&#34; somebody a 10-foot-long boat? Those things are seriously unweildy to cart around, but non-athletic Libby takes hers to the ocean with no problem. While kayaking, Libby hops out of the kayak and swims around before getting back into the kayak. Now, I own a kayak, and I'm very athletic, and it takes a heck of a lot of skill to climb back into a kayak from the water. If I can't do it, I highly doubt Libby could.I found the author's flippant and snarky perspective of cancer to be offensive. I was shocked at the end to read her statement about how cancer has affected many of her friends and family, and that she wanted to be respectful in how she dealt with it. I guess she was trying to match the light-heartedly fluffy tone of the book and deal with cancer in a light-hearted and fluffy way, but it really rubbed me the wrong way. And I have had cancer. Also, I get that Libby was dying and wanted to live her life, but her determination to have sex with somebody else besides her husband was very off-putting. Basically the first thing she did after her diagnosis was try to hook up with a co-worker. When that didn't work out, oh hey here's this dude in Puerto Rico that I have nothing in common with, except he's horny too. Talk about a rebound man- Shiloh was a disgusting love interest.

Unfortunately, in all of the places where Atwood's novel succeeds, 'The Last Girl' fails.I only give novels which I can't finish a single star, but this one came close to making me break that rule.

The villains are all disfigured, or easily recognizable by their sneers/general sliminess, and their motives make Snidely Whiplash's look complex. The secondary characters aren't memorable. The main character is just like any other female dystopian main character--she's spunky, can get pummeled on the regular and bounce back, handles a firearm well (despite only having seen them in holsters, on guards), etc, etc.Plot: 'Spunky girl fights evil dystopian establishment,' with a side of attempted rape, and bizarre cruelty toward the other young girls in the story. Far too much reliance on tropes, cliches, and archetypes to create 'twists' to move the plot.Writing style: okay. It's not 'pretty,' but it's mostly serviceable, without too much dry, clunky phrasing.Pacing: Very inconsistent. Far too much exposition. Much of the world-building is done in the form of characters reading in classroom lessons. (For comparison, 'The Girl with All the Gifts' does this brilliantly.)Overall, I wouldn't recommend this. If the premise of this book interests you, I would recommend 'The Handmaid's Tale.'***spoilers beyond this point*******There are so many things that didn't make sense to me in this story. Here are just a few.Why were the girls treated so poorly? It makes zero logical sense, other than causing the main character angst.Why bother such an elaborate system of lying to these girls? Their compliance was guaranteed regardless. It seems contradictory, given that the reader is told (repeatedly) how little the powers that be care for the girls.Why bother keeping the sperm donors around the facility?Regarding the abusive guard...If women are so precious, surely they wouldn't keep a guard around with a history of inappropriate contact.What purpose did Lily, the handicapped girl, serve? I was initially pleasantly surprised to see a handicapped character in this story. Unfortunately, it seems her inclusion is only to cause more angst for the main character.Last...I can't buy into the government slaughtering the bulk of the population. A country, torn by unrest, with its infrastructure going to pieces, finances in the toilet, somehow manages to coordinate and fund the slaughter and disposal of 300 million people? They convince their military (composed of citizens) this is the best course? Sorry, I can' t get on board that train.", user_id: user2.id, book_id: book124.id })

During her shift, Ruth begins a routine checkup on a newborn, only to be told a few minutes later that she&rsquo;s been reassigned to another patient. The parents are white supremacists and don&rsquo;t want Ruth, who is African American, to touch their child. The hospital complies with their request, but the next day, the baby goes into cardiac distress while Ruth is alone in the nursery. Does she obey orders or does she intervene? Ruth hesitates before performing CPR and, as a result, is charged with a serious crime. Kennedy McQuarrie, a white public defender, takes her case but gives unexpected advice: Kennedy insists that mentioning race in the courtroom is not a winning strategy. Conflicted by Kennedy&rsquo;s counsel, Ruth tries to keep life as normal as possible for her family&mdash;especially her teenage son&mdash;as the case becomes a media sensation. As the trial moves forward, Ruth and Kennedy must gain each other&rsquo;s trust, and come to see that what they&rsquo;ve been taught their whole lives about others&mdash;and themselves&mdash;might be wrong. With incredible empathy, intelligence, and candor, Jodi Picoult tackles race, privilege, prejudice, justice, and compassion&mdash;and doesn&rsquo;t offer easy answers.

To tell our struggles? To tell the world what it feels like in Black skin to deal with overt racism to passing microagressions? I quickly let go of those questions because Picoult never does any of that. Every page, dripping with white guilt, is the perception of what someone thinks Black life is. The novel is rife with stereotypes, a dichotomy between Ruth and her sister of a &#34;good Black&#34; and a &#34;Bad Black&#34; that I'm not sure even Picoult understands. Basic cultural cues watered down until its lossed its meaning. It's all too much of a reminder that indeed, Picoult does not know what it feels like to be Black.Funny, to me the only relatable character became the white supremacist. In his few chapters, you understand abandonment, loss, love, betrayal, anger and grief. Beyond race, gender and class you could understand his emotions, motivations and actions, albeit sometimes off character.

Not really, because I knew she would have a twist or three up her sleeves. It just wasn't surprising to me but it may be to other readers. (I read a lot and I read a wide variety of books, so it takes a lot to surprise me.)This book is about Ruth, a widowed African-American nurse, who is also a single mom. She loves her job as a labor-delivery nurse in a small hospital. She worked there for 20 years and never had a problem until one day, when someone requested that she doesn't take care of their baby because of her race. This request eventually led to a series of events where Ruth finds herself questioning the system she has lived in all of her life, worked in and everything she believed in.Kennedy is Ruth's lawyer, a public assistance lawyer who took on the case, determined to win the case for Ruth. As the case winds on, Kennedy finds herself questioning the status quo and realizes that not everything is as black and white as it may seem in the real world.Turk, the white supremacist father, who was so aggrieved at the loss of his baby son needed a scapegoat for his rage and sorrow.

This book is so riveting as it strikes a chord. Given the state of race relations in our country, the story is all the more haunting. To say that the issue of racial inequality has actually taken a turn for the worse, would be an understatement. The disparity in everyday life. I found myself doubting things that I have said, whom I may have inadvertently hurt or offended with no malicious intent. Reading this book made me sick to my stomach. But, I read on. It is important. Picoult is trying to get a message across. Please don't misunderstand, I was enthralled by the book. The story is passionate, intense, and portrays a deep struggle, which you want to read.I imagine some people will be doubters. How could the author possibly understand this situation, even if she is writing fiction. I have read interviews about the depth of research that she put into this book. She is not claiming to be an expert. She based it on a true story. The title comes from a line in a famous speech of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.&#8217;s: If I cannot do great things, I can do small things in a great way.&#8221;The story is about a nurse, no ordinary nurse, but one who is dedicated and well regarded, with a twenty-year career at the hospital where &#8216;the incident&#8217; occurs.

Review.create({ title: "An exciting new voice in the thiller / action genre", rating: 4, body: "The Atlantis Gene is the debut novel by A.G. Riddle.  It's a Science Fiction thriller that combines elements of the lost city of Atlantis, human evolution, Nazis, conspiracy, alien technology, and end of the world scenarios.The very basic premise (without spoiling anything) is that the human race was on the brink of extinction at one point in the past and somehow, for some unexplained reason, humans made a giant leap forward in the evolutionary ladder that allowed them to not only survive, but to take control of planet Earth.  Dr. Kate Warner is a researcher and an expert on human evolution.  She is living in Jakarta Indonesia studying and seeking a cure for autism.  One day while working on a new treatment with a pair of her autistic children, hooded soldiers move in, ransack the facility, and steal the children.  Shortly thereafter, agent David Vale shows up on the scene and he and Kate are sucked into a worldwide race against time to save not only themselves and the children, but quite possibly the whole world.This book was recommended to me by a friend.  He raved about it.  Told me it was a must read.  After getting through the first half of the book, I found the story to be solid, but nothing necessarily different or special.  As a matter of fact, I was a bit disappointed at how similar certain aspects of the plot were to Jeremy Robinson's Second World and James Rollins' Black Order.  And when I say similar, I really mean exactly the same.  I even called my friend to tell him that I thought the book was average in every way and was a copy of these other books.  I pressed on however and fortunately at about the halfway point, Riddle starts to separate his book from the others.  The plot thickens, the characters start to develop, and the plot starts to turn.The last 25% of this book is pretty fantastic.  There are twists that I never saw coming, and characters that I thought were token players that emerge near the end to change everything.  After spending much of the first half of the book at a jog, Riddle flips the switch towards the end and the pacing becomes very quick, and the action and story become intense.  The book ends with a refreshingly satisfying cliffhanger - just the right balance of closure versus setup for the next book.Riddle's first novel is not perfect.  The first half of the book should have been cut down some.  There are places where the story drags just a little bit.  I'm certain that those are minor issues that Riddle will get worked out as he continues to write.  All in all, he has given himself a very solid foundation to build from, and I feel certain that his popularity will only grow after this first very solid effort.", user_id: user1.id, book_id: book127.id })

The good guys come up with logically inconsistent theories about what's going on that happen to be entirely correct, even though the characters know nothing about the topics at hand and jump from one idea to the next as if we are supposed to accept these leaps of logic as somehow being rational.The core idea behind this book seems to be 80% generic Tom Cruise movie, 5% Stargate, and the rest a formless mishmash gleaned from reading a single Internet article on each of the topics: epigenetics, human origins, and the Spanish plague. All of this is vomited onto the pages in a nonsensical, vile squirming mass that will insult your intelligence.I laughed out loud A LOT while reading this book, and probably not where the author intended.

But after scanning the most recent 100 reviews, I began to wonder what book many of those reviewers had read. Had I relied on 98 of those reviews, I would have expected a far different book than the one I actually read.Let's begin with what LIFE OF PI isn't. It's not a Man against Nature survival story. It's not a story about zoos or wild animals or animal husbandry. It's not ROBINSON CRUSOE or SWISS FAMILY ROBINSON. It's not a literary version of CASTAWAY or OPEN WATER, and it's not a triumph against all odds, happily ever after rescue story. To classify it as such would be like classifying THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA as a story about a poor fisherman or MOBY DICK as a sea story. Or THE TRIAL as a courtroom drama, THE PLAGUE as a story of an epidemic, HEART OF DARKNESS as a story about slavery, or ANIMAL FARM as an animal adventure.Martel's story line is already well-known: a fifteen-year-old boy, the son of a zookeeper in Pondicherry, India survives a shipwreck several days out of Manila. He is the lone human survivor, but his lifeboat is occupied by a Bengal tiger named Richard Parker, an injured zebra, a hyena, and an orangutan. In relatively short order and true Darwinian fashion, their numbers are reduced to just two: the boy Piscene Molitor Patel, and the tiger, Richard Parker. By dint of his zoo exposure and a fortuitously positioned tarpaulin, Pi (as he is called) manages to establish his own territory on the lifeboat and even gains alpha dominance over Richard Parker.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user3.id, book_id: book128.id })

Review.create({ title: "Definitely Worth A Read", rating: 4, body: "I passed this book up perhaps dozens of times in the bookstore, before finally relenting.  From the description on the back of the dust jacket, it just did not seem like a story that would interest me.  Plus, several of the review snippets on the book -- essentially praising the author for making a book with such a spare story into a great novel -- seemed to me a little like damning with faint praise.As it turns out, I was half right.  I didn't like the story very much.  Well, actually, I very much liked the first hundred pages or so, which took place on land and described our protaganist; a young Indian son-of-a-zookeepper.  But I found the story thereafter that took place at sea to be a little too slowly paced for my tastes.  And some of the gore -- particularly the detailed discussion of the butchering of various sea fish and animals -- was too repetitive and, well, gross.But, it turns out, the story of a boy on a boat with a tiger is not really what the novel is about at all.  Instead, it's a novel that uses its backstory to ask a straightforward question:  Do we need stories and fables to believe in God?  (SPOILERS follow.)At the end of this novel, we are confronted squarely with enduring questions about the limits of faith.  How can we believe in God when a wonderful, kind, vegan, pious boy endures tragedy for no good reason?  How can that boy continue to believe in God when he witnesses, first hand, how human nature emerges in its cruelest form as 4 castaways on a life boat essentially turn into animals in less than 24 hours.  How can he believe in God when he watches helplessly as his mother is brutally murdered for no discernable reason?Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user5.id, book_id: book128.id })

Review.create({ title: "The Unbelievable Truth", rating: 5, body: "That Pi is the nickname of the main character and narrator of this tale is only the first little tidbit to digest in this delicious smorgasbord of a novel.  Pi the number, you see, goes on to infinity, so Pi the person, it can be reasonably assumed, does the same.  But there's so much more than this, it's almost impossible to get your mind around it.As everybody already knows, the plot has to do with Pi, a sixteen-year old Indian boy who practices three religions, and who gets shipwrecked in the Pacific Ocean on the way to Canada with his emigrant family.  He is the sole human survivor, but unfortunately--or fortunately as it turns out--not the sole survivor.  On the lifeboat with him are a 450 pound tiger and several other animals, and within a day or so, a 450 pound tiger.  The bulk of the novel has to do with the story of his survival, not only from the catastrophic wreck, but from the almost surreal horror of being confined in a ridiculously small space with one of the most dangerous animals on the earth.For the rich thematic nature of this novel come into bloom, this aspect of the story must be entirely believable, and I'm here to tell you, it is.  This is no Tom Robbins nonsense in which all living things get along simply because they are too cool for reality, this is nail-bitingly realistic, and nothing is left out.  In fact, if you're in this for the pure adventure of it, you can't do much better.Young Pi has a lot of things to think about.  First, there is the fact that his family has suddenly disappeared forever.  Then, there is the food and water problem.  Finally, there is, well, the tiger problem.  Should he try to kill it?  How?  With a knife, a rope, a flare gun?  What if he only wounds it?  Can he make it go away?  Can he somehow live with it?Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user12.id, book_id: book128.id })

Whilst war raged, Revolution at home was building. The conspiracy theory persisted that there were indeed survivors of the mass execution, people came forward who later in the 20th century claimed to be Tatiana or Anastasia or Olga the Romanov children who had somehow survived the massacre. And it is with this tiny percentage of doubt about the fate of the children that Gill weaves a credible and gripping story.Gill was alerted to a snippet on TV about a mooted relationship between Tatiana, one of the daughters of Nicholas and Alexandra, Tsar and Tsarina of Russia, and a cavalry officer and this serves as the foundation for a gripping time slip story.The Romanovs were the glittering family who were at the height of power as World War I started. Their glamour and wealth were beyond comprehension, they were synonymous with sparkling jewels, opulence and of course Faberg&eacute; eggs. As the war took its toll, however, the disparity between their wealth and ruthless rule, and the poverty of the populace lay at the heart of the burgeoning revolution.Cavalry officer Dimitri Yakovlevich Malama and Grand Duchess Tatiana forge a close friendship after she nurses him in a makeshift war hospital.novel set in russia The world as they know it is unravelling around them. War takes him to several fronts, yet they maintain a close and chaste connection and on the eve of yet another departure, they marry in secret.

Review.create({ title: "Great Read!", rating: 4, body: "This is the second time I have read ORDER OF THE PHOENIX and I enjoyed it just as much as the first time. Rowling is absolutely brilliant at creating wonderful characters and placing them in a magical world where, despite its dangers, I would love to live.That's not to say that PHOENIX doesn't have issues. All of the later POTTER books went on too long and desperately needed more editing. I expect this was the result of their huge popularity and the publisher trying to get them out as quickly as possible. Not that I was bored. I wasn't. But... [SPOILER ALERT! DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IN THE BOOK. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!] ...after the final battle at the Ministry with Voldemort, and after Sirius has been killed, the story needed to be wrapped up quickly. Yes, we needed to hear what Dumbledore had to say to Harry, but after that, Rowling should have quickly set up the next installment and ended it.There were also some literary missteps in this one (at least in my opinion): Umbridge would have NEVER followed Harry and Hermione into the Forbidden Forest. She was far too suspicious by nature. Harry took far too long to rescue Sirius. Of course we later find out it was a setup and Sirius wasn't really in danger (initially), but the unreality of this drew me out of the story. Rowling tried to cushion it by constantly referring to the fact that Harry's scar wasn't hurting him enough to think Sirius was already dead, but this never worked for me. I kept saying to myself, &#34;Voldemort would have killed Sirius by now. He's never hesitated to kill anyone else.&#34; I also felt the final battle at the Ministry as Rowling described it was unbelievable. Harry and his friends were surrounded by Death Eaters in a room, and yet I was supposed to believe the Death Eaters couldn't hear Harry's whispered instructions to Hermione. Regardless of the size of the room, the Death Eaters would have been close enough to Harry, et al, to keep them from escaping. I also didn't buy that the exploding shelves would have been sufficient enough a distraction to allow the escape of Harry and his friends. They were all right there together, so everyone, good guys and bad, would have been impacted by the explosions. Am I being too picky? Perhaps. But my feeling was that Rowling didn't visualize the action sufficiently, which I have seen her do with other action sequences.But here's the thing--despite these flaws, this is a wonderful book, and the whole series is an incredible accomplishment, so its flaws are inconsequential. There have been few book series written that have created a more irresistible world, and few book series that have so positively effected this world.

Review.create({ title: "Dolores Umbridge, the most evil character in the Harry Potter series.", rating: 5, body: "It's hard to write a review for a book in a series that you've read more times than you can remember, and seen the movie more times than you could count. From that statement alone it should be obvious that I'm a big fan of the Harry Potter series. Do I write my review based upon my first time reading it, or the everlasting impression this book has left me with? I think that fact that this book has made me think and ponder certain ideas over the years, I think the everlasting impression should be the topic of my review.After encountering Dolores Umbridge, I was left pondering the question &#34;What is evil?&#34; Voldemort is obviously the Villian of the series, however I feel Umbridge is a much more sinister and evil Villian than even Voldemort. Voldemort's actions and evil deeds are really very simple to understand. What motivates him is power and greed and he is willing to go to any lengths to achieve those goals. While evil in itself, his motives and actions are very straight forward and easy to understand. It is easy to see Voldemort for the evil that he is, which therefore keeps him in hiding only surrounded by his Death Eaters. Dolores Umbridge is a very different type of evil. Dolores Umbridge is the type of evil that we, the muggles that we are, encounter on a daily basis. They are the people who enjoy the hurt, pain, chaos and distrust they cause through their manipulations and lies. The enjoy the devastation they cause in their wake. The fact that she can create the heartache she relishes so much with a false smile, sweet sanguine falsetto, and splashes of whimsy to give the impression of navet&eacute; and an innocent childlike behavior which puts one off initially of comprehending the true evil she inflicts to hide the monster she is, and the fact that through these false tactics she has risen to a position of power to inflict heartache unto others, shows she is a master at hiding her true psychopathic personality. This sick personality trait is shown most clearly when she makes Harry write lines in detention. She knows Harry is telling the truth, yet she lies and manipulates him until she is in a position of power directly over him in detention at which point she not only continues her lies causing mental anguish to Harry, she continues her evil machinations by causing him physical pain by forcing him to use her quill which scratches and ultimately scars Harry for the rest of his life. Umbridge enjoys Harry's suffering. She even inspects his hand at the end of each detention to make sure he is being cut and that his hand is bleeding and then in a well satisfied way compliments Harry on completing his detention. Her only praise is when Harry does something to cause hurt and pain and twists what he knows is the truth into something false. This is standard textbook psychopathic behavior in domestic abusers.The fact that Doloros Umbridge can navigate society in such a way as to gain a position if importance in the Minisrptry of Magic and flourish in normal wizarding society while hiding her insidious psychopathic tendencies leaves her in an excellent position of power to inflict hurt to others. Her brand if evil is subtle and is not so obvious at a first glance which gives her the ability to &#34;blend in&#34; with others and yet she victimizes many in her wake, as she navigates through life. In Voldemort's case, his brand of evil is so obvious to everyone that he is an outcast of the wizarding community, which ultimately lessens the number of his potential victims to those simply standing in his way of power, while in Umbridge's case her victim pool is limitless die to her access to the community and all those she comes across.So here is the moral question I have pondered for many years since reading this book for the first time. &#34;Which Behavior Is More Evil?&#34; Personally, I feel Dolores Umbridge is the much more evil of the two characters based upon the reasons given in the prior paragraph. Whether you agree or disagree with me is not the point. The point is to make you think and ponder for yourself. The fact that this book makes you think long after you've turned the last page, is a mark of literacy success. Whiter you've read Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix once, or a hundred times, it is always a great novel to read again and again, and question what constitutes as evil.", user_id: user2.id, book_id: book131.id })

We didn't start buying these for our collection until book #5 when the series had gained such a huge following. We were so glad we could find these individually here on Amazon to get the missing ones.The Prisoner of Azkaban continues a fascinating and engaging series. Book one of the series was very lighthearted as the world and characters were introduced. There was indeed a conflict and a villain, but the focus was on the world itself and the magic we could find in it. Book two continued in that world but had a noticeably darker tone (as did many of the later books). However, Book three returned us to a lighter tone while creating a self-encased conflict and villain with some really neat time-travelling plot twists (think of Bill and Ted or Back to the Future). The last four books tell more of a continuous narrative while I feel that each of the first three is more standalone. Yes, they end with an explanation of how the self-contained events fit into the overarching conflict of the series. But the individual plot elements of the books seem to lend themselves to the story at hand rather than the overall conflict. It seems that this changes with Book four when many parts of the book focus more on the overall plot rather than the individual book plot.Even if you've seen the movies, the books are deserving of a read. The cliche that the books are always better than the movies holds very true here. We hope that JK Rowling continues to write for many years and that she can create other worlds that are equally as imaginative and engaging as this one.

For all the talk about GOBLET being the one where Rowling really hikes up the intensity and the complexity in the series, it is here, in PHOENIX, she gives us Potter's darkest, and most complex, adventure of all.The second most complex novel in the entire Potter sequence (the first being Book 7), this book is probably the second best one, though I still like Azkaban better.  This novel introduces the Order of the Phoenix, a whole litany of new characters and a more indepth look at the Ministry For Magic.Potter has been having bad dreams about a locked door.  So he must find out what to do about that.  While at home with the Dursleys, he and Dudley are attacked by dementors, and so he stands trial before the Ministry for the inappropriate use of underage magic.  He ultimately must appear before the Ministry, and it is only by Dumbledore's appearance he is saved.But the Ministry is not finished yet.  Still under staunch denial that Voldemort is back, Cornelius Fudge sends a new teacher, Dolores Umbridge, to bring Hogwarts under the Ministry's control.  Much of the storyline revolves around Umbridge as she takes over Hogwarts, eventually ousting Dumbledore, who goes on the run.  Her end is very well justified.I remember when I read the book back in 2003 when it initially came out being rather disappointed.  I wasn't a big fan of GOBLET, and I couldn't way to spend more time in Harry's universe, being back at Hogwarts with characters I know and love.  But when I read PHOENIX, though, I felt even more lost and rather alienated.  Hogwarts was being taken over.  Hagrid was missing for half the book.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user8.id, book_id: book133.id })

Rowling faces when she sits down to write a Harry Potter book.Though she's said she worked out the whole seven-book series on a fateful train ride she took in the late '90s, she couldn't possibly have imagined that the series would turn into this: midnight bookstore parties, record print runs, and a generation of children (and adults) hanging on to her every written word.This has now reached a new apogee with its fifth entry, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, the longest (870 pages) and most dense (more characters, more complexity) book of the series.And Rowling once again pulls it off.Harry's adolescent funkPhoenix begins in the usual place, the Dursleys' house at number four, Privet Drive, in Little Whinging, England. The Dursleys, Harry's guardians, have become more frightened of Harry's magical abilities -- and the now 15-year-old Harry, having sunk into an adolescent funk of bitterness, anger and self-pity, is more than happy to keep them guessing.But Harry soon has bigger problems. Once he's back at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he's treated as a pariah by most students for his insistence that the evil Lord Voldemort is back -- and, indeed, played a role in the death of a student at the end of Goblet of Fire.Only a handful of professors and Harry's close friends -- among them Hermione and Ron -- support him.Harry also struggles with the series' latest villain, Dolores Umbridge, a condescending representative from the Ministry of Magic who assumes a leadership role at Hogwarts. The students' psychological battles with the odious Umbridge are the best parts of Phoenix, and Rowling writes them with a wicked zest.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user12.id, book_id: book133.id })

Review.create({ title: "A stunning and thoroughly satisfying conclusion", rating: 5, body: "This is arguably the most hyped book in history, and if J.K. Rowling had to sneak down to the kitchen for a glass of red wine to calm her nerves while writing The Goblet of Fire (as she said she did), one wonders what assuaged her while writing Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. The collective breath of tens of millions of readers has been held for two years...and now...was it worth the wait? Did Ms. Rowling live up to the hype? (For that, amongst hundreds of questions, is really the only question that matters.)The answer, most assuredly, is YES.Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is told in a strikingly different style than the previous six books - even different from The Half Blood Prince, and, I daresay, it's a better written, better edited, tighter narrative. And while the action is lively and well paced throughout, Rowling found a way to answer most of our questions while introducing new and complex ideas. What fascinated me was this: Some people were right, with regard to who is good, who is bad, who will live, who will die - but almost nobody got the why part correct. I truthfully expected an exciting but rather predictable ending, but instead was thrown for a loop. We've known that Rowling is fiendishly clever for years - but I didn't think she was *this* clever.Not since turning the final page of The Return of the King twenty-eight years ago have I felt such a keen sense of loss. My love affair (indeed, everyone's love affair, I imagine) with all things Harry began somewhere in the first three chapters of The Sorcerer's Stone, and has lasted, on this side of the Atlantic, three months shy of nine years. For all that time we have waited and wondered - was Dumbledore right to trust Snape? Will Ron and Hermione get together?Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user14.id, book_id: book133.id })

Trigger Warning includes previously published pieces of short fiction&#8212;stories, verse, and a very special Doctor Who story that was written for the fiftieth anniversary of the beloved series in 2013&#8212;as well &#8220;Black Dog,&#8221; a new tale that revisits the world of American Gods, exclusive to this collection.Trigger Warning explores the masks we all wear and the people we are beneath them to reveal our vulnerabilities and our truest selves.

In Adventure Story&#8212;a thematic companion to The Ocean at the End of the Lane&#8212;Gaiman ponders death and the way people take their stories with them when they die.

Gaiman offers his own ingenious spin on Sherlock Holmes in his award-nominated mystery tale The Case of Death and Honey. And Click-Clack the Rattlebag explains the creaks and clatter we hear when we&#8217;re all alone in the darkness.A sophisticated writer whose creative genius is unparalleled, Gaiman entrances with his literary alchemy, transporting us deep into the realm of imagination, where the fantastical becomes real and the everyday incandescent. Full of wonder and terror, surprises and amusements, Trigger Warning is a treasury of delights that engage the mind, stir the heart, and shake the soul from one of the most unique and popular literary artists of our day.", amazon_link: "https://www.amazon.com/Trigger-Warning-Short-Fictions-Disturbances-ebook/dp/B00KPV9PIW", kobo_link: "https://www.kobo.com/us/en/search?query=Trigger%20Warning:%20Short%20Fictions%20and%20Disturbances%20Neil%20Gaiman", play_link: "https://play.google.com/store/search?c=books&hl=en&q=Trigger%20Warning:%20Short%20Fictions%20and%20Disturbances%20Neil%20Gaiman" })
Review.create({ title: "A Neil Gaiman short fiction collection--with one original piece from the world of  American Gods", rating: 5, body: "Trigger Warning is a collection of 24 pieces of short fiction and poetry written by Neil Gaiman. If you know what a trigger warning is (I had to look it up) you may be thinking this collection is darker, edgier, and/or more risque than it really is. (For those who dont want to look it up, a trigger warning is a blurb that intimates that a work has words or images that may induce a traumatic reaction.) However, these stories are Gaiman to the core, which means they are humorous, clever, and often quirky; but they are unlikely to throw one into catatonia or an apoplectic fit. The pieces include Sherlock Holmes and Doctor Who stories, spin-offs from Sleeping Beauty and American Gods, as well as a few homages to other authors, including Ray Bradbury, Gene Wolfe, and William Blake.Without further ado, Ill give a rundown of the included works:1.) Making a Chair: This is a poem about writers block.2.) A Lunar Labyrinth: An homage to Gene Wolfes work, Solar Labyrinth. This short story is about a maze that was destroyed, and that wasnt to be walked on full moon nights.3.) The Thing About Cassandra: This is among my favorite stories in the collection. What happens when your friends and family start bumping into the girl who you made up as a girlfriend back in school?4.) Down to a Sunless Sea: This was written for a water-themed event. Its about a person riding in a lifeboat down the Thames toward the sea.5.) The Truth is a Cave in the Black Mountains: This one was inspired by an island off Scotland called Skye, but the story is fantasy with magic elements. A man strikes out in search of revenge and closing, regarding a daughter who he thought had run away. This is one of the most engaging pieces in the collection.6.) My Last Landlady: This is a story, conveyed in poetic form, about a mean landlady.7.) Adventure Story: In the Introduction, Gaiman calls this a companion piece to his novella The Ocean at the End of the Lane.  However, I didnt make that connection, (and Ive read that story.) At any rate, its a great story about an intriguing artifact left behind by a [deceased] father whose stories were always painfully dull. Its told by a mother to a son who is incredulous that his, seemingly milquetoast, father lived through such a fascinating event.8.) Orange: Like several of the pieces in this book, this one is unconventional / experimental. However, its creative, and it works. It consists of answers to a questionnaire, from which the reader pieces together the story. One doesnt have the questions, but most of them are fairly clear from the context of the answer.9.)  Calendar of Tales: This is what it sounds like, 12 stories each matched to a month. Its another of the unconventional and unusual pieces. Each story was spun from a tweet response to a question about a given month of the year.10.)  The Case of Death and Honey: Few characters in the public domain have spurred as many offshoot stories as Sherlock Holmes, and this is Gaimans entry in the pool. Holmess interest in bee-keeping is central to the story.11.)  The Man Who Forgot Ray Bradbury: An homage to Bradbury. If one forgets a person, did they ever exist?12.)  Jerusalem: This work was influenced both by a poem by William Blake and a trip the author took to said city. The story is about a couple of tourists and the unique mental illness associated with this locale.13.)  Click-Clack the Rattlebag: A scary bedtime story told by a child about a different kind of monster.14.)  An Invocation of Incuriosity: A story about one of the strange and colorful people one might meet at a flea market.15.)  And Weep, Like Alexander: A light-hearted story about an un-inventor, one who keeps you from having flying cars and all the other promised technology from sci-fi.16.)  Nothing OClock: This is a Doctor Who story. Its not necessary to be familiar with the series (necessary backstory is provided), but it could make it more appealingi.e. the inside joke effect.17.)  Diamonds and Pearls: A Fairy Tale: This is from Who Killed Amanda Palmer? Palmer is a cabaret-punk singer/songwriter and Gaimans wife, and the aforementioned booklet consists of a series of photos of Palmer looking deceased with brief stories to go along. This is one of the stories that could stand alone. Its a fairy tale of the adults-only variety.18.) The Return of the Thin White Duke: Another fairy tale, this one about a Duke that strikes out on a quest for adventure in order to rescue a Queen who doesnt need rescuing.19.)  Feminine Endings: A story about a human statueby that I mean one of those people who deck themselves out and stand on a box in the town square in touristy places in many parts of the world.20.)  Observing the Formalities: A poem about one who doesnt get invited.21.)  The Sleeper and the Spindle: A take on the story of Sleeping Beauty, but from a different point of view.22.)  Witch Work: This is another poem. I believe its the only one thats not free verse. Its about the life of a witch.23.)  In Relig Odhrain: This is a true story about a saint, written in free verse.24.)  Black Dog: This is a spin-off from the novel American Gods and it features that books protagonist, Shadow. You dont need to have read that book, but you might have a greater affinity for the story if you have. It should also be noted that this is the one piece that is original to this collection, and its one of the most substantial pieces in the collection. i.e. it gives fans a reason to pick up the book even if theyve read a lot of it from the original source.I enjoyed this book. Gaiman is a masterful story teller. Whether its one of conventional pieces based in established worlds (e.g. Doctor Who or that of Sherlock Holmes) or one of the off-the-wall, experimental pieces, these stories and poems are a pleasure to read.", user_id: user1.id, book_id: book134.id })

But for some reason, people begin to be  attacked by someone - or something. Harry, Ron, and Hermione start on  another slew of detective work to find out what's going on, and how to save  the students of Hogwarts...it's hard to give a plot summary without  exposing the secrets of the ending, which, by the way, was a total  surprise!This book is truly engrossing, more intense and frightening  than the first. I loved it! It was both fun and funny, much like the other  two in the series. It is interesting to read, and I honestly think it  appeals to all ages. Even older readers will enjoy being taken back to the  days when the line between fantasy and reality was blurred, and all the  books would keep any modern teenager enthralled. Harry Potter No. 2  actually kept me laughing throughout. At some points in the middle, the  story may get slightly bland, but don't worry: the best part is yet to  come. I love children's stories, have read many, and these are the best,  most modern works out there. There's a reason they are so hot right now,  and all these other 5-star reviews are deserved! This series breaks the  ordinary mold of children's books which are not always written with the  same flair J.K.

Review.create({ title: "Houston, We Have A Problem. Several, Actually", rating: 2, body: "Were I to rate this book simply on the plot, it would score far higher. It is beyond intriguing and unfolds at a fairly decent pace. That said, I have major issues with this book, which is why I'm giving it (just barely) two stars. First, this isn't so much a trilogy as a single book broken into three different parts. Compare it, for example, to the original V.C. Andrews Flowers In The Attic trilogy, where each book stood on its own as a complete story. This book arbitrarily ends on a cliffhanger, and in order to get a complete story, you have to purchase the other two books. Which means you are paying over $20 for the complete story. Beyond that is the quality of the writer. While the author clearly knows his stuff when it comes to science, he is in desperate need of a writer. Sentence structure is not his friend, and there are typos galore. As a self-published author who works hard, in conjunction with an editor, to make my books the best they can possibly be, I have become increasingly, wildly frustrated with books such as this which simply do not live up to the implied contract between an author and a reader; a contract which promises not only to tell a good story, but to do so in conjunction with an editor who will make sure that the reader is getting their money's worth as opposed to something which feels haphazardly slapped together. While the story raised questions that I'd love to have answered, I have absolutely no intention of throwing good money after bad in order to find out how the tale ends.", user_id: user1.id, book_id: book153.id })
Review.create({ title: "Disaster of a book", rating: 1, body: "Oh my. Where to begin with these books? Yes, I purchased and actually read all three in the series, and I'm not sure I can explain why, especially since they got progressively worse as the series unfolded. I was intrigued by the description of the first book, the advertisement for which popped up on the home screen of my Kindle. It could have been so good! But it just wasn't. The book's author must have paid a significant sum to have it advertised in this way. Otherwise I can't imagine anyone in a position to make marketing decisions would willingly advertise or recommend anything so poorly conceived and constructed. I wish I had better understood this before I purchased these things.Someone should have taken a giant red editorial pen to all this, for starters. Here are some specific things I didn't like about this book and the subsequent two:* Way too many things going on, and no real cohesion for any of it. Aliens! Dinosaurs! Mummies! Genetic tinkering and bio-engineering! People turning into animals and talking! Crazy tornadoes! Robots! Traveling through space and time! Sharks! Meteors! Viruses! Government conspiracy! Sinking ships! I'm sure I'm forgetting something here, but you get the picture.* In the spirit of the list item above, too many characters. Hard to keep up with all of it and where they were in the world, and what they were pursuing.* Some of the worst dialog I have ever read.* Chunks of tedious, excessively dry scientific theory and jargon to wade through. I think book two had an entire chapter of it at the beginning, and it bored me to absolute tears. I'm still not sure what this chapter was there to communicate, or how it contributed to the story, to be honest.* The beginning of book three didn't remotely connect with or pick up where book two left off. Totally confusing. Preview of book three was at the end of book two but I had skipped it, preferring instead to pick it up from the beginning of book three. It was so baffling I had to go back to book two and read the preview. This helped connect some of the dots, but then something that happened in the preview totally didn't happen in book three. Something entirely different happened.* Parts of these books felt preachy. Like the author had some personal moral agenda to promote.* Book three appeared to be more of a work in progress or draft than a finished product. There were literally whole sentences - lines of text with strike-through font where the author (or &#34;Editor&#34;?) revised the content, and I guess ran out of steam to actually remove them.I hope this is helpful. Reviews are completely subjective, and as a good friend always says, &#34;There's an @ss for every saddle&#34; -- so if it still sounds good to you, then by all means! Download and enjoy!.

Review.create({ title: "Pretty good, would recommend, but not great", rating: 3, body: "Well, it's hard to review this, there are a few things that bother me but overall it's quite an enjoyable story and one that keeps the pages turning. I'll probably use this review for all 3 &#34;books.&#34;My biggest complaint unrelated to the story is how these books are divided and abruptly end. There is absolutely NO need for this. All the sudden you're turning and BAM, here you can read the excerpt from the next book but you know that's just going to end as abruptly OR you can buy the next book now. So I've bought the second only to find it does the same thing. Frustrating to say the least especially since the third won't be out for another week. This story does not feel like a 3-part series like other Sci-Fi or Suspense type series and could easily be combined into one book which would be preferable.My other gripe is that the book jumps around all over the place with the stories and it feels like a suspense movie that's been edited with fast cuts like an action movie. You're barely settled into a chapter and then you're thrown into a different place. The chapters could be doubled up to provide a little more length and hardly affect the story. I understand what the author is trying to do and I appreciate the effort but it's too much.With all that said I have enjoyed reading it and it's good entertainment with an interesting story that generally keeps you wanting more and moving you forward. The depth of accurate science and history is shallow but considering how wide the story is it makes sense and I'm OK with that. I would recommend this book to Sci-Fi/Doomsday/Suspense/Mystery fans for sure.", user_id: user3.id, book_id: book153.id })

He doesn't want or need fans AND he certainly doesn't want a relationship. Alex may be okay with the animosity he is causing around him however, team management is not. Because of his bad attitude, Alex is required to do community service; he will be the spokesperson of a new drug-abuse awareness program.Sutton is the social worker Alex has to work with.

Sutton is able to see through Alex's bad-boy facade because of her personal and professional experiences.As Alex and Sutton begin to work together, a friendship develops then turns into something more intense. Alex was not an easy man to like. In fact it was damn difficult. There were times in the book that I was so angry with him, but there were even more times that I wanted to hug his pain away. That being said, I loved watching the ice around Alex's heart melt away. Alex made some bad decisions but by the end of the novel he more than made up for them in a way that was sweet, romantic and oh so swoon worthy.Alex is written in dual POV and is the first in the Cold Fury Hockey series with seven books listed as of now.

He&#8217;s bitter, closed off, and an A one a hole. He could care less about the game, his teammates or the fans of the Raleigh, North Carolina Hockey team Cold Fury. He plays hockey because it was forced on him by a father who lives through him not for him. Since he was young, Alex&#8217;s father has only cared about making him a top hockey player, refusing to allow Alex any time for himself or his other passions, and this has led to a very solitary lifestyle as a professional hockey player, and it&#8217;s also thwarted his love for a game that he&#8217;s played his entire life. Alex plays hockey because that&#8217;s what he knows; if he could quit, he would, but there&#8217;s nothing for him to fall back on, so he guts out every game, scoring and assisting when he needs to but feeling completely void of any excitement, which shows in how he treats everybody involved in his career.But all that&#8217;s about to change.

He&#8217;s all for giving back, but what rubs him the wrong way is the fact that he&#8217;s forced to do it in order to not be benched and he won&#8217;t give in without making it known how unhappy he is.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user13.id, book_id: book154.id })

The Troubles Keeper starts as many Stephen Kings great novels do; as a person gifted with powers they dont understand but propel them into situations where courage, bravery and fortitude are demanded by the everyman.  The everyman in this is Rory Fine mid-twenties, bus driver, regular guy who enjoys his job but has always been aware he has a special gift. That gift is literally taking the troubles (sad emotions, worries, grief) from others when he touches them, making them feel better about their station in life. It doesnt last forever; but it is a relief. So as not to burden himself with things that overwhelm others, Rory stores the troubles in an attic he has created in his mind.All is dull and normal and day-to-day in Rorys life until he meets Marianne. He is smitten, but something else is going on. Rory detects something special in her and while he summons the courage to speak with her he also notices a darkness about him. This darkness is not from the cosmos, but from another bus passenger.As Rory relives the traumatic events of his life he meets with a former teacher at his middle-school who has theories, quite bizarre about what this all means. There is a connection between Rory and Marianne and the dark force is determined to stop it. Will that force succeed? Who will suffer at his pathology? How many innocents will die before Rory can uncover the truth? Or, if he can ever uncover the truth.Susan May proves once again why she is the foremost genre writer of the suspense/thriller/supernatural novel.

It is funny, tender, thoughtful and thought-provoking.  The character of Ove seemed a bit too curmudgeony at first, but as his story unfolded, it all fit.  A touching perspective on loss and what it means to choose life and figure out one's new role as a loner.  It also celebrates the importance of coincidence and embracing what life brings.Laughed out loud and blubbered like a baby--what more can one ask of a book?

Review.create({ title: "A Book for everyone", rating: 5, body: "There is a part of me that didn't think I needed to review A Man Called Ove because so many people have read it at this point, but I have talked to a few who have not, hence my desire to write this review.I will admit that I am entirely on the Ove train!The book is about a man, named Ove, who is the angry neighbor that we all seem to have. He complains about everything, has put up signs around his neighborhood with rules about what should and shouldn't be done, and feels there is a proper place for everything. He is not a friendly guy to say the least.Into his life walks or rather drives a family who are to be his new neighbors. He doesn't bother to get to know their names and calls them the pregnant one and the lanky one. After an accident with the lanky one, Ove is forced to help this family, complaining the entire time.Throughout the book Ove also speaks to his wife, complaining about the neighbors, the rule breakers, and how much he misses her (very minor spoiler). During interludes within the narrative, we read about how Ove became Ove. I will say by the end of the book, a bunch of dust was flying around the room and some got into my eyes.The first thing to write is this book is funny. Ove is quite the character and how he treats people is hysterical. He just doesn't care what he says or how he says it. He simply wants order in his world and has lived that way for all of his life. The way he expresses himself becomes incredibly funny.It is also a tragic story. Backman interweaves the two (funny and tragic) quite well and doesn't make it overly heartwarming. This could have easily become a book with the sentiment that we don't know people's past, so don't judge them, but it isn't. Ove is an ass in his past too and sometimes with reason. Backman keeps it level with just enough to make the reader fall for Ove.The great thing is this is a book that pretty much anyone and everyone can (and will) enjoy. I recommended this one for book clubs and discussion groups. Grandmas will like this as well as middle aged men. Ove is simply a good book.I gave this one 5 stars.", user_id: user4.id, book_id: book156.id })

I loved the love/hate relationship between Jesse and Thor (his cat). I laughed because I can relate. I enjoyed the relationship between Maddy and Jesse as well (for obvious reasons). It was more true to life than most of the stories out there. Single mom trying to make it on her own. But the way Maddy went about it separated it from other stories. For me there are 2 downfalls: 1. No epilogue. The last chapter was way too short. I think a few more pages and some more extras would have been perfect. Then added an epilogue...it would have been a 5 Star read then. 2.

Review.create({ title: "COMPELLING...COMPLEX...PROFOUND...", rating: 5, body: "Winner of the Boston Review's Fisk Fiction Prize, this thematically complex story is written in clear, simple, lucid prose. It is a straightforward telling of an encounter that was to mark fifteen year old Michael Berg for life. The book, written as if it were a memoir, is divided into three parts.  The first part of the book deals with that encounter.While on his way home from school one day in post-war Germany, Michael becomes ill. He is aided by a beautiful and buxom, thirty six year old blonde named  Hanna Schmitz. When he recovers from his illness, he goes to Frau Schmitz's home to thank her and eventually finds himself seduced by her and engaged in a sexual encounter. They become lovers for a period of time, and a component of their relationship was that Michael would read aloud to her. Michael romanticizes their affair, which is a cornerstone of his young life. Then, one day, as suddenly as she appeared in his life, she disappears, having inexplicably moved with no forwarding address.The second part of the book deals with Michael's chance encounter with Hanna again. He is now a law student in a seminar that is focused on Germany's Nazi past and the related war trials.  The students are young and eager to condemn all who, after the end of the war,  had  tolerated the Nazis in their midst. Even Michael's parents do not escape his personal condemnation. The seminar is to be an exploration of the collective guilt of the German people, and Michael embraces the opportunity,  as do others of his generation, to philosophically condemn the older generation for having sat silently by. Then, he is assigned to take notes on a trial of some camp guards.To his total amazement, one of the accused is Hanna, his Hanna.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user3.id, book_id: book158.id })

Review.create({ title: "A revised reading of relationships", rating: 5, body: "The topic of the Holocaust is raised almost every day in some manner. Many books have been written about the topic. Whether in studies, documentaries or fictional accounts, finger-pointing at the perpetrators of the crimes against millions has been part of the process of coming to terms with the Nazi atrocities. For Imre Kertesz, renowned author and Nobel laureate of 2002, there is no other topic. Yet, when he reflects on the traumatic impact of Auschwitz, he dwells on the vitality and creativity of those living today and thus, paradoxically, not on the past but the future. Bernhard Schlink, professor of law and practicing judge in Germany, born in 1944, has attempted to capture the struggles of his generation in confronting the past and the future in The Reader.  Pointing at the guilty party did not free us from shame, his narrator and protagonist contemplates, but at least it overcame the suffering we went through on account of it.The usually unambiguous distinction between villain and victim has facilitated the identification with those who lost their lives or suffered under the Nazi atrocities while all scorn, abhorrence and hate was piled on the perpetrators. Until recently, few books have focused on the after-war generation. While growing up, the children had to come to terms with the, often sudden, exposure of their parents' active or passive participation in the crimes of the Nazi regime.  The Reader, set in post-war Germany and against the backdrop of the Frankfurt Auschwitz trials of the mid-sixties, takes this new and, for our generations, important angle: in the form of the fictional memoir of Michael Berg.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user7.id, book_id: book158.id })

Review.create({ title: "A Unique Topic - Post WWII German Youth", rating: 3, body: "What impressed me far more about this book than the main plot (15 year old has sensuous affair with much older woman who turns out to be former SS Guard), was a seemingly minor issue in the book. That issue was that of how  the sons and daughters of the Germans who lived in Germany during WWII  dealt with their &quot;Holocaust Legacy&quot;. My parents are Holocaust  Survivors, and I have read a lot about the Holocaust, but little has been  written on the topic of that first generation of Germans born after the end  of WWII. The author articulately and clearly describes how the sons and  daughters of those Germans who lived through WWII absolutely had no respect  for their parents; that the sheer force of the genocide that their parents  conspired in, ignored, or did whatever, demanded that their children's  feelings toward them just had to plunge far deeper than the  &quot;typical&quot; disdain which every generation of young people have  toward their parents. My only wish is that the author had delved into this  topic even further; as he himself was born in Germany in 1944, he is indeed  a member of that postwar generation of Germans, and therefore has a unique  perspective on the subject. As for the book generally, the plot was nothing  short of incredible. With that said, I thought Parts I and III (the  beginning and ending of the book) were very well-written; the author does a  great job describing the sensuous affair of the teenager, and a great job  at the end, about his conflicting feelings towards his former lover during  and after her trial, and about what ultimately happens to her. However, the  middle of the book was awful; it was written in a superficial manner, with  no real character development. So remember: just keep reading until the  end. All in all, a fascinating portrayal, from a German, of what it means  for the post-war German generation to live with tremendously complex  feelings concerning the Holocaust and their parents.", user_id: user12.id, book_id: book158.id })

From the first descriptions of Molly's treasured sea glass, I felt like I was on the beach with her sensing the incredible feeling of finding these wonderful colorful pieces.

This series just keeps getting better and more gritty. We are back at Club X for Issac and Katia's incredibly intense and emotional story. Both are trying to deal with the past... and what broken and horrible pasts they've had to endure. Katia was kidnapped and held as a slave for four years, while Issac witnessed his mothers murder. They are both deeply wounded souls who have a very unconventional way of finding healing in each other.Both are understandably damaged and scarred but they are both strong and are coming over the other side of their pain. Even though the book does deal with some dark areas the authors don't go into explicit detail on Katia's past... the book is more about healing - which what makes it so beautiful in my opinion.We met Isaac in the previous book &#34;Bought&#34;, but that glimpse of him didn't even prepare the reader for the man we see in this book.This story was very dark and heart wrenching at times, but you just can't put it down or give up on the characters - there were parts that had me just shocked and devastated, but these great authors take us on an excellent journey and the ending is worth the roller-coaster ride.

Even though I was gifted a review copy by the authors, I had to purchase it (you have to support your favorite authors to keep them writing).  Katia and Isaac are both tortured by events in their past.  I think the authors did a good job of bringing Katia's torments and coping to the pages of this book.  I loved the twist with Katia's on-line friend.  Even though the book deals with some dark subjects, the authors don't go into explicit detail on Katia's past.  The book is more about healing.

He's into the BDSM lifestyle, but more Master/slave relationships. It's what he needs. He has yet to find his perfect slave.Katia owns a doggy daycare/shelter. Katia suffers from debilitating night terrors regarding her past. While Isaac uses his business to deal with his past, Katia uses hers to cope. Katia receives an invitation to Club X and that's where she meets Isaac. Their first encounter is amazing, but it doesn't end as Isaac planned. Katia is afraid, and with her past, she has reason to be. Isaac wants to be her everything. He needs to convince her that he is the Master that she needs. Katia needs to put her painful past to rest and let Isaac take care of her. Isaac realizes he could never keep Katia; she's too good for him, but he can help her heal. Isaac wants to save her from her past, but who will save him?Isaac is a genuinely good man. He wants to do right by Katia. He's led a hard life and that's what made him who he is today. Katia is just trying to get by, from one day to the next. She needs what Isaac can give her, but she fears that by giving up complete control, it might lead to Isaac becoming her jailer. They are so much better together. Isaac was patient and willing to do whatever it took to heal Katia.Based on the the blurb, I thought I had a good idea about what this book was about. Wrong.

Now I dont know about you but I think I might have found that almost as awkward as she did and that is saying something!She had no idea what was coming her way when she accepted that job but then again I dont think Jace did either because when she walked back into his life again it was as if he was right back in high school because Lucy wasnt the only one that had harboured a secret crush.Sexy as sin Jace was on very thin ice when it came to offering Lucy the position as his marketing director, he had rules for how things should be between staff and that included him but all that was before L.E.T.O (Lucy Entered The Office) because now he may just be the one breaking that very same rule.I loved his attitude, he called it like he saw it and wasnt afraid to say exactly what was on his mind, Lucy on the other hand had a rod of steel running through her because no matter how down, how despondent you would have thought she would be, she soldiered on and what she didnt initially overcome she buried but Jace knew that he was there to help her find that tiger again, to see through the BS, start again and stand tall.The interaction between the two of them were mixed, they were playful, they were flirtatious, they were sexy and eventually they were off the charts! They brought out the best in each other and that was fantastic to read.It isnt all plain sailing there is a hiccup along the way ( I did mention that ex earlier) that had the potential to derail everything for them both and again not just personally but professionally too. But could they survive, would they see what they had and fight to make it work?This is a couple that you will root for, they came across as normal, the flirtatious banter, the humour and the attitude, it all made them ultimately relatable.", user_id: user4.id, book_id: book161.id })

Even if you've seen the movies, the books are deserving of a read. The cliche that the books are always better than the movies holds very true here.

We typically try to put God into a human box and if God was like us, by the time we come around to even looking into who He really is, we'd have blown it past any hope of redemption.

A pandemic unlike any before it has swept the globe. Nearly a billion people are dead--and those that the Atlantis Plague does not kill, it transforms at the genetic level. A few rapidly evolve. The remainder devolve.As the world slips into chaos, radical solutions emerge. Industrialized nations offer a miracle drug, Orchid, which they mass produce and distribute to refugee camps around the world. But Orchid is merely a way to buy time. It treats the symptoms of the plague but never cures the disease.Immari International offers a different approach: do nothing. Let the plague run its course. The Immari envision a world populated by the genetically superior survivors--a new human race, ready to fulfill its destiny.With control of the world population hanging in the balance, the Orchid Alliance and the Immari descend into open warfare. Now the last hope for humanity is to find a cure. Kate alone holds the key to unraveling the mystery surrounding the Atlantis Plague. The answer may lie in understanding pivotal events in human history--events when the human genome mysteriously changed. Her journey takes her across the barren wastelands of Europe and northern Africa, but it is her research into the past that takes her where she never expected to go. She soon discovers that the history of human evolution is not what it seems--and setting it right may require a sacrifice she never imagined.__________________________________________________________________&#x22;The human race must remain as one.

Ultimately, I was able to follow along enough to really dig the technical stuff and care about the characters.  The story touches on so many facets of the human experience: science, religion, history, evolution, biology, physics, good vs. evil.

Review.create({ title: "Ugh.. Reasons why I found this book infuriating.", rating: 2, body: "So, like many others, I read the first book and thought it was pretty good, and seeing the higher overall Amazon rating, I went ahead and bought the second.  I immediately added on the Audible 'whisper sync' for it, as I listen to books on my walk to and from class (so about an hour each day).  Normally, I love listening to books, as it draws you in, and makes my walk go by really quickly.  As a result, I can forgive quite a bit, since it's largely to fill in this walking time in an enjoyable fashion.  However...Never have I been so fed up with a book!  The first fifth of the book I was okay with, the exposition was a bit excessive (and could have been handled better, as it came across a bit condescending to the reader), but I was willing to look past that.  After that, it became increasing infuriating (I'll get to why in a moment), and I found myself rolling my eyes, and muttering 'ugh' and sighing to myself, as the narrator droned on (doing the best with what he was given).  I probably looked crazy.. I ended up turning it off halfway through, and have since switched to re-listening to the Silo series (fantastic by the way), as I'd rather repeat a good book, than listen to this one.  Which is saying a LOT since I even allowed myself to zone out during this book, and even that couldn't make it tolerable.Okay, now for reasons I can think of at the moment..**The dialogue.. oh god, the dialogue.  Enough said.**The characters are either ridiculously dense, or incredibly clever.  It's as though they were given lists of prerequisite skills/knowledge before embarking on this journey--in that each seems to know exactly the right information on cue as needed.**The amount of times a character says &#34;I don't understand&#34;, or something synonymous, deserves a tally of its own (hey, make it a drinking game! by the end you will have the same ability to put together pieces of the puzzle as the characters!).**No one dies!!! And I don't mean the character's random abilities to come back to life (which seem to come and go)--I will look past that even.  There are so many ridiculous, dangerous situations they walk straight into, and no one dies! Authors really need to not be afraid of killing off a main character for the sake of a more realistic story.  I really should have counted how many times a character was in a situation where they should have been killed, but somehow, miraculously, escaped the scenario.  Hell, when Martin died (spoiler alert) I was about 75% convinced that he would not stay dead.**The uniqueness granted to Kate became annoying.  By that I mean the amount everything revolves around her becomes a bit much. Again, I know she's the lead, but still.**Along that line, the scenarios are just beyond suspension of disbelief.  I know, I know, it's fiction and adventure/sci-fi-ish, but even for the genre, the plot pushes the limits.  Oddly enough, the scenarios become repetitive, like an episode of House, or Bones, where you kinda know the overall arc of each episode before it starts.  As a result, each dangerous scenario becomes boring, because you already know how it's going to end up.**The characters are unlikeable.  I struggled to even find one that I didn't mind and maybe even liked.  Which is really annoying.  I tried, I really did, but just couldn't.  Oh, maybe Naomi, she seemed pretty cool.  (too bad she was only around for fifty pages or so).  Ooh, and that random guy who was in the trial in China--the backstory about his impoverished family and him moving to the city to find work was rather interesting.**The 'relationship' between Kate and David is just annoying, and poorly done.  The physicality between the two also was written from a man's unrealistic perspective (like, I'm sorry, but after an incredibly physically/emotionally draining escape, would they really want to hook up immediately?).**The author does seem to have done quite a bit of historical research, which deserves some credit, (I'll assume it's all mostly true), but it's given in such a way that it felt like I was back in history class--not good.**The author writes to the readers are though we are all idiots, nothing is left to be deduced and no credit is given to the reader's ability to not need every little thing spelled out as though it was geared towards 12-year olds.**The story becomes rather muddled by about a quarter of the way through.Ugh.  Yeah, so, clearly I don't recommend this book.  I would recommend the first book, but just ahead and treat it like a standalone novel, and NOT the first in a trilogy..So, the stars:  1 for the overall cost being pretty low, and 1 more because the narrater did a pretty good job. If I had managed to get to the end, I'd have added another one, just since it seems as though finishing deserves a star.. So, 2/5", user_id: user5.id, book_id: book165.id })

A single cell, joining with another. And then dividing. And just like that, the world changes. Annie Harlow knows how lucky she is. The producer of a popular television cooking show, she loves her handsome husband and the beautiful Los Angeles home they share. And now, she&#8217;s pregnant with their first child. But in an instant, her life is shattered. And when Annie awakes from a yearlong coma, she discovers that time isn&#8217;t the only thing she&#8217;s lost.Grieving and wounded, Annie retreats to her old family home in Switchback, Vermont, a maple farm generations old. There, surrounded by her free-spirited brother, their divorced mother, and four young nieces and nephews, Annie slowly emerges into a world she left behind years ago: the town where she grew up, the people she knew before, the high-school boyfriend turned judge. And with the discovery of a cookbook her grandmother wrote in the distant past, Annie unearths an age-old mystery that might prove the salvation of the family farm.Family Tree is the story of one woman&#8217;s triumph over betrayal, and how she eventually comes to terms with her past. It is the story of joys unrealized and opportunities regained. Complex, clear-eyed and big-hearted, funny, sad, and wise, it is a novel to cherish and to remember.&#160;", amazon_link: "https://www.amazon.com/Family-Tree-Novel-Susan-Wiggs-ebook/dp/B01825C50W", kobo_link: "https://www.kobo.com/us/en/search?query=Family%20Tree:%20A%20Novel%20Susan%20Wiggs", play_link: "https://play.google.com/store/search?c=books&hl=en&q=Family%20Tree:%20A%20Novel%20Susan%20Wiggs" })

I was not disappointed &#8211; at first.  The beginning of the novel was original and the set up for the plot was technically perfect.Annie Rush, a dynamic, young woman from the cold Northeast, lived with her wonderful family. She idolized her Gran, respected her mother, liked her brother and was angry with her father who left the family.  Annie was filled with ambition and she was intelligent and talented to balance her determination.Growing up, Annie worked in the family business, making the best maple syrup.  Wiggs provided the reader with a solid understanding of the process and it was laborious and like many small businesses, so much depended on good labor and conditions.  Annie had her own special talent for cooking, enhancing recipes and her outgoing personality and intelligence skyrocketed her to success.But as many chick lit novels evolve, nothing is easy and a man would break her heart.  Tragedy occurred and Wigg&#8217;s description of the medical trauma and rehabilitation was the best of the book.  She made it real and plausible.What was way overdone was Annie&#8217;s romance with the &#8220;boy&#8221; from back home.  Despite a solid love story, there were too many breakups that it made it far-fetched, and it appeared the author was augmenting the novel to make it longer and longer.  The same theme was repetitive to the point of being superfluous and unessential.Because of the back and forth of her career, romance and family crescendos, the plot became predictable. I was waiting for a few twists, but there were none.  I am sure Ms. Wiggs has a targeted market for her fiction and she could have added me as a fan if she had eliminated plot recurrences. 3.5 stars", user_id: user2.id, book_id: book167.id })

Her writing style is clear, her characters are relatable, and her storylines are realistic - full of rich emotional content without being melodramatic.Annie Rush seems to have it all.  A satisfying, successful career, a handsome, gifted husband who shares her passion for food/cooking, a lovely home and the fulfillment of a dream to become a mother. Perhaps predictably, all this perfection tempts the fates and in one tragic moment, she loses it all. That moment stretches out into a year as she remains in a coma only to awaken with little to no memory of the event or her most recent past.Seeking refuge in the her family home of Switchback, Vermont, Annie slowly and steadily regains her memories and rediscovers herself, her passion and her authentic, creative voice.  What makes this story unique is the backdrop of the maple farm which has been in her family for generations.  The author devotes a significant amount to time to explore the intricacies of running a small, family business, specifically the care and maintenance of the maples trees and the production of the final product: Sugar Rush maple syrup. Vermont and the maple trees emerge as characters in their own right.Another thing that separates this novel from the usual chick lit romance is the care given to describing the nature of traumatic brain injuries and the arduous path of rehabilitation.  Clearly the author has done her research to be able to address these issues with such insight and compassion.The novel evolves in alternating chapters labeled &#34;Now,&#34; &#34;Then,&#34; and, lastly, &#34;After.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user3.id, book_id: book167.id })

Let's keep that between us. (Narrator Nick Offerman) With The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, not even Twain could have known that when he introduced readers to the inhabitants of the fictional town of St. Petersburg, Missouri, he would also be introducing two characters - one a clever and mischievous scamp, and the other a carefree, innocent ragamuffin - whose stories would ultimately shape the course of American literature. But whereas its sequel and companion piece, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, would harken an end to childhood, the story of Tom Sawyer is one that depicts the excitement and adventure of boyhood along the Mississippi. Revisit this enduring classic and you will be struck not only by Twain's skill at capturing a time and place so vividly but also by his uncanny ability to crystallize those oftentimes tumultuous and conflicting emotions that a child experiences at the precipice of adulthood: a longing to be free from the rules and obligations of adults while enjoying the laxity inherent in childhood; a love of all things macabre, like blood oaths, cemetery cures, and haunted houses, that reveal a true innocence - an unawareness of real-life consequences and one's own mortality; and the pangs of guilt when knowing the right thing to do and doing the right thing appear to be at odds. A natural storyteller and raconteur in his own right - just listen to Paddle Your Own Canoe and Gumption - actor, comedian, carpenter, and all-around manly man Nick Offerman (Parks and Recreation) brings his distinctive baritone and a fine-tuned comic versatility to Twain's writing. In a knockout performance, he doesn't so much as read Twain's words as he does rejoice in them, delighting in the hijinks of Tom - whom he lovingly refers to as a great scam artist and true American hero - while deftly delivering the tenderness and care Twain gave to his own characters.

For example, most books where you may click to look inside will default to the most common paperback.  For books like Tom Sawyer, that is fine if you need the book for high school English class, where any copy cheap enough to write notes in the margins will do.  I wanted a copy of Tom Sawyer to keep and love.  I saw this publication on Amazon, but it had so little info and the one review given was a single sentence about the general value of Twain's story.  The truth is, one doesn't buy this particular printing unless one is already convinced of it's literary excellency!  So I am about to do Amazon a huge favor by telling you what it didn't tell me.  For about $15, the asking price at the time of this review, you can invest in a real treat for your self or someone you love and wish to inspire.This printing was meant to mark the one hundredth anniversary of Twain's death (2010).  The story is unabridged, provided in full original text.  It is positively rich with watercolor illustrations by Robert Ingpen.

Although this book had great potential, it was not found here.  The concept of two opposing societies, one of male dominance and the other of female dominance, was intriguing.  What the author failed to do, however, was to spend much time describing these worlds and exploring how they were different and yet the same .  Instead the bulk of the novel dealt with a budding romance between the main character and her testosterone driven beau.  The end result, to me, was that the novel reflected more of a harlequin than a dystopic viewpoint.

Viloet does too many annoying things that don't make sense. The fact that she is picked for this mission makes no sense. She's a known violent, juvenile, criminal so why her? It would have made more sense if more than one girl was chosen. For such an important mission she was quite the unpredictable person.She wanted to be defiant so much. Why? Just shut up for a few weeks and be submissive then you're home free? I understand that she is a Matrian girl who has made a life of being defiant, but that is exactly why I don't understand why she was chosen for this mission.Anywho, she does redeem herself, somewhat, halfway through and the writing even seemed to pick up better halfway.

Published in 2010, The Kitchen House became a grassroots bestseller. Fans connected so deeply to the book&#8217;s characters that the author, Kathleen Grissom, found herself being asked over and over &#8220;what happens next?&#8221; The wait is finally over. This new, stand-alone novel opens in 1830, and Jamie, who fled from the Virginian plantation he once called home, is passing in Philadelphia society as a wealthy white silversmith. After many years of striving, Jamie has achieved acclaim and security, only to discover that his aristocratic lover Caroline is pregnant. Before he can reveal his real identity to her, he learns that his beloved servant Pan has been captured and sold into slavery in the South. Pan&#8217;s father, to whom Jamie owes a great debt, pleads for Jamie&#8217;s help, and Jamie agrees, knowing the journey will take him perilously close to Tall Oakes and the ruthless slave hunter who is still searching for him. Meanwhile, Caroline&#8217;s father learns and exposes Jamie&#8217;s secret, and Jamie loses his home, his business, and finally Caroline. Heartbroken and with nothing to lose, Jamie embarks on a trip to a North Carolina plantation where Pan is being held with a former Tall Oakes slave named Sukey, who is intent on getting Pan to the Underground Railroad. Soon the three of them are running through the Great Dismal Swamp, the notoriously deadly hiding place for escaped slaves.

I loved the Kitchen House and have it in my top 10 favorites and now this book is up there also basking in the glory of the fantastic story that it gave me to read.  This author is exceptional!!!The story starts off from where the Kitchen House left off but with a miner character from the Kitchen House.  You read about Jamie but didn't really get to know him there as you will in this book.  The chapters alternate between the different characters telling their side of the story and it works so beautifully.  It's really nice to have that perspective to give you the personal feeling of knowing each character as if you are standing right beside them having them tell you personally.  It's pure genius!The storyline is mostly about Jamie with Pan following in as close second.  It's intense to the point that it will have you sitting on the edge of your seat holding your breath waiting to see what happens next.  The last third of the book is just complete block buster action, emotions, anticipation and so much more.  This really is one gripping story.I personally would not read this as a stand alone because when you get to a certain area in the story where there is some back reference you will be lost.  Not that it couldn't be read as a stand alone but I wouldn't just because you need that back history to live the intensity of the storyline.  I don't usually give any book a 5 star unless it really moves me and this did.  It is graphic but so were the times and subject matter.  All I can say is this would be a fantastic mini series on tv.My last notes here is if you have read the Kitchen House then read Glory Over Everything because it is just as good.

It continues the story of Jamie who was ran away from Tall Oaks. He was the son of Belle, a slave, and the master of the plantation in Virginia. He had been taken from Belle and raised as his grandmother&#8217;s child and she instilled in him a hatred and view of slaves that they were inferior.  He has the experience of &#8220;passing and the feeling of not belonging to the white or black world.  He makes it to Philadelphia and has to find a way to eat and have shelter so he applied for a job at silversmith shop. He had always been artistic and loved to paint and carve birds.Like Kitchen House, there is a narration of the brutality of slavery but now the problems of being close enough to white to pass is added.  Like the slaves that ran away from the plantations, a deep fear was present every day of their lives that they might be found out and then have to go back to life either as a servant or a slave. But if they did go back, they would never be accepted because of their light color.Jamie risks being found out and caught and then sold as a slave when he goes to rescue the little boy, Pan who used to be his servant. Pan&#8217;s father pleads for Jamie to find in the South and bring him back.Pan is a small in build but big in bravery, he wanted to please Jamie by purchasing another parrot but that got him caught and moved down South.  There are many great characters in this book like Robert, the loyal and very educated servant, Adelaide Spencer, a daring young woman determined to live life to its fullness and the kind couple, Mr. and Mrs. Burton.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user6.id, book_id: book170.id })

Once the narrative stops and flashes back to thirteen-year-old Jamie and his elevation in Philadelphia society, the reader already has so much information about his future that tension and conflict are essentially neutralized. As a result, the first half of the story may feel somewhat tedious and poorly paced where it could've been engaging and suspenseful if the reader knew far less about how things turn out for Jamie by 1830.The plot also relies quite heavily on coincidence to heighten its tension, which delicately undermines the plausibility of things to come.Despite these observations, fans of THE KITCHEN HOUSE should definitely experience GLORY OVER EVERYTHING for its wonderfully researched historical ambiance, the notable insight to the grossly inhuman slave trade, the ravages of plantation life, the courage of the Underground Railroad and the sheer endurance of the human spirit!", user_id: user13.id, book_id: book170.id })

True love and vast wisdom exude from those soulful eyes. Eyes that may have seen many lives.This is a novel of acceptance, loyalty,survival and greater than anything....true love that never ends.Scientific research has told us that a dog does not remember, that we humanize them to serve our own needs. The research also breaks down every behavior into a rational explanation. All well and good. Science has its place, but can't explain why the Tornado dog from Alabama, separated from his family dragged himself back to the site of his destroyed house towing 2 broken legs.Read this book more than once, buy as many copies as you can get, and give one to each person who knows that a dog is much more than the sum of scientific research.I bought 10 copies and plan on buying more.Sit down in a comfortable chair with your best friend next to you, and don't get up until you have finished this most touching story.

This is my first book by Ella Carey, and it won't be my last. This book is a beautifully written story that is both heartbreaking and hopeful at the same time.

One day, her ninety-four year old grandfather, Max, reveals a secret from his past...he tells Anna that she is actually from an aristocratic family, but that the family lost everything during World War II. Anna is completely shocked, and is even more shocked when he asks Anna to go to Germany to retrieve something he has hidden there more than seventy years ago. She does not understand why he never revealed this before, and she wonders why it suddenly so important to him. Curiosity and loyalty has her agreeing to do what he asked of her. After she arrives in Germany, she meets a man, Wil Jager, who helps her to do what she set out to accomplish. In the process, Anna learns more about her grandfather, and more secrets are revealed.The story alternates between the WWII era, and present day...and vividly explains what happened so long ago and why it is so important to Max.

People that lived through that era often found it easier to stay silent and keep their heartache hidden rather than to talk about their history and reveal their pain.

Max has always refused to discuss his past, so Anna is mystified by this request.  Ultimately, she goes to the town in east Germany and runs into myriad obstacles in her quest to get into the estate.The story alternates between the 1930s with a love story involving Max his French girlfriend Isabelle and 2010 in which Anna seeks the truth about Max with the assistance of a young lawyer Wil.  In the process, Anna develops romantic feelings to this young man.  It also alternated among points of view of the various characters.  I don't always like books that do this, but I thought it worked well in this novel.I enjoyed the book, especially Isabelle's story, but I didn't think the modern day romance was necessary.  I thought the characters were fairly well developed, but for me the main focus was the story which dealt with events leading up to World War II and in the war itself.", user_id: user3.id, book_id: book189.id })

Review.create({ title: "ALCOHOLIC AMNESIA", rating: 4, body: "THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN is a dark, haunting and depressing psychological thriller, but it's incredibly effective thanks to the writing skills of author Paula Hawkins.  Rachel is a divorced woman who would do anything for a drink, and like a lot of folks consumed by a love affair with the bottle, one might call her a victim of circumstances.  Her husband Tom had an affair that resulted in a pregnancy.  He divorced Rachel, married the other woman and now all three (husband, wife and child) are happily ensconced in the house that was once Rachel's.The train that Rachel rides to London each day takes her past her old neighborhood.  From the window of the train she observes not only her old garden that backs up to the tracks, but also the daily activities of another couple who reside down the street from her previous home.  In her imagination she has given the couple names and has created a fairy tale love life for them. Real life, however, cannot live up to her fantasy and the couple does not have the picture perfect relationship that Rachel has concocted.  When a murder occurs, Rachel becomes entangled in the investigation because of what she has witnessed on her daily commute.This rather bleak story with intersecting timelines is told from the viewpoint of three different women Rachel, Anne and Megan.  All the women are unreliable narrators with something to hide.  In fact, most of the characters in this novel, including the men, lack veracity, and are a self-serving and unsympathetic group with plenty of skeletons in their closets.Lest I continue and divulge too much of the plot, let me just say that the twists and turns in the story are many and readers will be easily drawn in, making it easy to devour this book in one afternoon.", user_id: user2.id, book_id: book192.id })

Then my interest began waning and quickly was transformed to annoyance, impatience, outright irritation and finally, full-blown dislike. I ended up really disliking this book. I thought the plot was so implausible and contrived - and, of course, many suspense/mystery novels are implausible and contrived, but this is yet another one of the type that has no foot in reality - as to be unacceptable. It veered into absurdity. More than that, however, was my increasingly intense dislike for all of the characters - every single one of them, but probably most of all, the main character, Rachel. I found her alcoholism, her black-outs, her laxity, her passivity, her strange behavior even outside of her alcoholic binges, everything about her just repugnant. But that was true of every character for different reasons and to varying degrees of dislike. The stylistic technique of alternating &#34;voices&#34; was OK and the different female characters represented in those voices were fairly well distinguished, enough so as to follow &#34;their chapters.&#34;  One thing that I did appreciate, and it stands on contrast to &#34;Gone Girl&#34;, was the absence of detailed, specific, &#34;graphic&#34; sexual material. There were indirect references but we weren't forced into the beds, bodies and minds of people in sexual encounters - and I appreciated that!  I didn't find any obvious type or similar types of editing errors, also appreciated. I thought the basic style and quality of writing was OK, outside of plot. Character development was OK, but they were just so thoroughly unlikeable and unlikely, in my opinion.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user9.id, book_id: book192.id })

Review.create({ title: "Baffled by Its Success", rating: 2, body: "I think I would ordinarily cut this book more of a break because it is fast-paced - Hawkins wastes zero time describing anything that doesn't have to do with exactly what is going on in the moment - and while that doesn't make her a great writer, there is absolutely nothing here that will transcend, or reverberate within you long after you've finished reading - it at least doesn't bog you down with preciousness. But because the book has received so many rave reviews - I have to judge it more harshly because it just isn't deserved. This is serviceable writing at best - about the level you'd read on Fiction Press - about the level you would get from a first year MFA student. If someone is digging around in something, they are 'scrabbling' (over and over). The lead character's blackouts are along the lines of: &#34;I couldn't remember. It was all dark. All black. All cloudy. Couldn't remember.&#34; I'm making that up, but it's not significantly different. So, that's the writing, let's get to the plot.The book is told from the POV of three different female characters, none of them compelling in the slightest. We're supposed to care deeply that a woman who chronically cheats on her husband disappears. I really didn't care that she did, frankly. Then we're supposed to care that Rachel, who drinks too much on the train while she pretends to commute to a job she doesn't have and obsesses about her ex-husband and her 'barren womb', may or may not have witnessed a crime. I didn't care about Rachel, didn't care about the woman who'd gone MIA. Now let's get to the third character you can't care about - Anna. I don't even remember her place in the story I cared about her so little.Read more &rsaquo;", user_id: user12.id, book_id: book192.id })

Review.create({ title: "Pretty good entry in the lone hero thriller genre, except...", rating: 3, body: "I have mixed feelings about this book.  The story is chocked full of action, intrigue, high-tech gadgets, shadowy government types who may or may not have America's best interests at heart, and straight-shooting good guys (and women) who have to figure out ways to work together.  Hero Jon Reznick is cut from the same cloth as Mitch Rapp, Court Gentry, or Will Robie, a seasoned professional operating in the high-stakes world of espionage, black sites, and assassinations, complete with a tragic back story and a young daughter he tries to shield from his grim work.  So, no complaints here.The biggest problem I had with the book is a technical one; namely, the author repeats many of the same phrases over and over.  And over and over.  I lost count of how many times Reznick &#34;felt a surge of anger&#34; or a &#34;rising tide of anger,&#34; how often his &#34;mind flashed back&#34; to something, only for him to be &#34;snapped out of his reverie&#34; by a sudden sound, how the characters continually started their sentences with the word &#34;look,&#34; as in &#34;Look, I'm telling you&#34; or &#34;Look, here's the situation&#34; or &#34;Look, I understand that...&#34; and so on.  And I have never read a story where the characters sigh so much.  The last third of the book was filled to the brim with &#34;He sighed,&#34; &#34;A long drawn out sigh,&#34; &#34;She sighed loudly.&#34;  I'm amazed they didn't all pass out, they were expelling so much carbon dioxide.  The repetition of the same phrases became such a distraction that I couldn't enjoy the book as much as I would have liked.  A good editor should be able to give things that final polish.All in all, a solid thriller that will keep you occupied as you lie on the beach or wait for your flight in an airport lounge.

(it's sort of like being unemployed and becoming a writer but less complicated, I suppose) In the final moments of a job, he talks to the victim (never a good idea) and begins to have doubts.In order to ensure that his doubts don't spoil his otherwise perfect record, someone kidnaps his daughter.&#34;Someone&#34; made a very bad mistake.Reznick, who really sort of reminds me of the Juggernaut from the old Spiderman comics, tucks the intended victim under his arm, and goes hunting. OK, he mostly tucks the guy in the trunk but the imagery was better the other way. Like the Incredible Hulk (I'm going with the Marvel Comics analogies and you can't stop me) he pummels people, cars, and small buildings all the way down the East coast on a steady diet of Dexadrine and coffee.I do have to remark that this is an error on J.B.Turner's part. I know from personal experience that when you work past 72 hours straight, regardless of the amount of various chemicals you may use, you end up in the hospital. Yes, that ward where they lock the elevator.But that's a minor quibble. Turner flips constantly between Reznick and the FBI team trying to bring him down. It's like the way The Wire portrayed both dealers and cops as tough people--just in different lines of work. The dialog is excellent and Turner describes Washington DC so accurately that I was thinking of having a cup of coffee with him until I learned he lives in England. (My novel, &#34;Courier,&#34; and &#34;Hard Road&#34; are both published by Exhibit A)It's a cliche to say &#34;the action never stops&#34; but in Hard Road, it really NEVER stops and the number of destroyed vehicles gets close to &#34;Fast and Furious&#34; levels. But it's all completely believable and totally engrossing. I read it straight through and enjoyed every page.", user_id: user2.id, book_id: book194.id })

It is a thicker book than the previous books, and it is a lot heavier for sure.  The quality of the book itself is excellent.  Dust-jacket is very nice.  Constructed same as the previous books.  Story-wise, things just get more and more interesting that you can't put the book down and don't want to stop until you find out what is next after each page.This is my favorite book of the entire series.  It is very dark in some places, but the flashbacks into the past in where we learn so much about Voldemort or Tom Riddle are very interesting and engaging.  Danger is everywhere.  Everything seems to be at risk, and you just don&#8217;t know what will happen next.  Nothing seems to be safe anymore.  There is also a little romance, but tension as well.  It&#8217;s a pretty big book.  A lot of pages to read.  But, I was able to read it over a weekend or so with determination.There are so many plot lines in this book, and the pace does not let up from first page to the last page.  There are new twists and turns.  I cannot reveal without spoiling. This is definitely an excellent book.I recommend this book for sure.  It is priced fairly I think on Amazon.

I get more out of each book upon every re-read, and this one especially. One of the great joys of the series, and especially of HBP, is the humor JKR manages to thread throughout the story, even as things are sad, or scary, or serious. The tiny references to Harry's burgeoning affection for Ginny, the way Fred and George manage to slip in one-liners even as chaos is erupting around them, it always feels like a gift from the author. This book, maybe more than any of the others, also really takes the time for character development. This is the book where Hermione becomes one of the great female characters in fiction, and where Harry stops being the victim of constant happy accidents and starts making his own choices. Plus it's just a really great mystery story! And ties in so importantly (obviously) with the overarching mythology.I will always remember receiving this book the day it was published (July 2007, right?), a day I had to go to a wedding and also shop for a big dinner party. I hid the book under my seat at the wedding and kept turning the pages behind my ankles, only looking up at the ceremony every page or so. Then I had the book balanced on my shopping cart, blindly tossing vegetables and cans in as fast as I could. When I got home, I finished the rest of the book by 2am, texting with my sister, saying, &#34;I'm on page xxx.&#34; We finished within a few minutes of each other, exchanging comments on what sobbing messes we were. Later that week, I was walking to lunch and saw a girl sitting in the sun outside of the bank (where she presumably worked).

I bought the book because it was on sale in the Kindle edition, and I was ready to be disappointed.  I was won over about halfway through. It is much stronger in the Etruscan sections than when Caecilia is in Rome.  The author's writing gets better as the book continues, and she is clearly more comfortable writing about Etruria than Etruscan Rome.  If you love Rome, you may be put off by her unsympathetic portrayal of the early Republic.  The characters are not well-rounded, and the dialogue seems stiff.  When she reaches Etruria, this all disappears. I found myself amazed at the detail. Do we really know this much about the Etruscans these days?  I have been buying books on the Etruscans to find out, and so far I've been able to find her sources for most of it.  It has inspired me to read more about this fascinating people. My remaining qualm is the drug use described in the sections on religion. I have not found anything that even suggests it in the literature.  I was also disappointed that it ended as a cliff-hanger.  It would have been equally interesting if she had simply indicated that Caecilia's story would continue.  I look forward to buying the sequel.", user_id: user1.id, book_id: book196.id })
Review.create({ title: "Before there was Rome......", rating: 4, body: "Cheers to the author for giving us an incredibly detailed and interesting look at the world of the Romans prior to Caesar's reign.  I don't remember ever learning in school any details about the Etruscan area of what is modern day Italy or the beautiful city of Veii, which lies only 12 miles across the Tiber River from the city of Rome.  In the approximate era of 365 BCE - the city of Veii was much larger than Rome and appeared to be far more sophisticated and worldly.  They held women to be contributing, worthwhile citizens, able to own land and make decisions without the control of either husbands or male relatives, something unheard of in the heavily male dominated Roman populace.  While the interwoven romance between a Roman female and a Veientane warrior/leader was enticing - it was learning that world even existed.  Some of the same gods/goddesses were worshipped - albeit under different names.  But, where the Roman citizens were a sober, male dominated society - the citizens of Veii were fun-loving, free thinking individuals with a highly developed city infrastructure and a love of all things beautiful.  For example, a Roman potter might craft a drab, unremarkable vessel for containing water, wine or food - while the Veii potter strove for beauty and  fine quality in their works.  The love story involves a very young Roman female from a well-respected family being used as pawn in being married to an older  Veientane leader as a means of ensuring peace between the two cities.  I simply can not stress this series is invaluable in imparting the knowledge of a different look at the Italy we learned about versus what really was and the learning is made enjoyable through the personal look of two people who grew to love each other without reserve - even though that was not the original intent.  This is actually a series of 3 books, including &#34;The Golden Dice&#34; - #2) and &#34;Call to Juno&#34; #3.

She's portrayed as a strong female, yet she still follows much of what is expected of a female during this time period. The author does a great job at bringing to life a period of time which I know very little about.

And, I was NOT disappointed at all.Mayra's sleazy ex-boyfriend told her she was horrible at sex and that the rest of her didn't make up for it so she decided to take a sex class called, blowjobs and beyond, hoping to improve before her next relationship. The regular instructor was out sick so her friend, Phillip was filling in. Mayra thought Phillip was hot at first sight and he liked what he saw in her as well. During and after class they flirted with each other but Mayra got scared and ran away. Thinking they would never see each other again, they both spent the night fantasizing about one another.

All I can say is that it hit me just the right place and I was rolling around the floor while reading this book. I found it absolutely hilarious.First of all, I have never thought about being a Vlogger and what that all means. Yeah, I have seen videos on YouTube and seen bedrooms and rooms in the background, but I have never thought more about it. Until now!Avery is a vlogger. She is giving sex advice to both men and women, and she is really successful. The problem is that she has been single for the past six months and her ex-boyfriend was not her roots to inspiration. Thats why she is running out of material to vlog about, in a slow but steady pace. She has earned enough money by vlogging to buy a house in a small town, and she has just moved in.Knox is living next door to Avery. He is a single dad to a thirteen-year-old daughter, and he has never been in a relationship, because of her. He wants to give her a steady upbringing, and therefore its just the two of them. Piper, his daughter, and Avery becomes friends really fast, and this is when Avery and Knoxs fight not to give in to the attraction between them, begins.Mrs. Sowood has really nailed it or is it me she has nailed (?) this time. I found her characters funny and sweet and I could have read much more of them. Knox is a really cocky bastard, but I would have to admit that he was swoon worthy.The chemistry between Avery and Knox was delicious, and the sex scenes were sizzling hot.I hope Simone Sowood continues to write with this humor, because I have not had enough of that, for sure.Thanks to Simone Sowood for this hilarious advanced copy.PS.
